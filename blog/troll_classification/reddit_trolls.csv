"I think what is more pertinent is that he *made* people pay attention to it before the internet and CU. By reprehensible means, but he had a lot more traction than anyone else with his views in the era.

The fact that no one paid attention to these ideas (that other people commenting are correct, are kind of easy to come to) until he had the country in deep terror and fear of their own fucking mail, maybe speaks more about the society he was terrorising than the terrorist.

Its kind of easy for anyone alive in the free world in this modern day to be like ""no duh"" but it might be worth remembering that the era he was terrorising in did not have the same kind of free exchange of ideas facilitated by the internet (mach smaller and localised surface area of media distribution), academics (like those he studied) were even more isolated than it is now, like you couldn't access scientific research papers without being a scientist yourself, government and free market trust was a lot higher, environmentalism was still hippy shit and not a mark of social credibility and the early era of computers was a really uncertain time compared to it being inherently entrenched in our lives.

"This is basically the crux of it: the money is, at least in theory and most likely in practice, absolutely there for companies to try and gouge.  What's more important, and currently more concerning, is what percentage of the available money velocity that gets devoted to different industrial sectors.

Maybe the main reason that the US economy truly took off and QoL  standards reached such relative high heights is that the US figured out how to reduce the proportion of money (and time) spent on food and housing (and other absolute essentials), which then allowed that now larger portion of unspent money to be redirected into less essential things that increased innovation, entertainment, etc, and overall QoL.

As the prices of food and especially housing continue their burgeoning exponential growth, this will reduce the amount of available money to be spent on the non-essentials, which will at minimum hamper future improvements, if not reverse growth trends.  

The US has been wise in the past to subsidize the agriculture industry to maintain low prices, and it's attempts at making home ownership more attainable were well intentioned but didn't come with enough caveats to prevent problems (too much strict zoning, ease of corporate ownership, societally turning people away from construction, etc).  Problems in those systems have come home to roost and will need some federal intervention to both ease the current pain and prevent the inevitable future pain that comes from inaction that our current legislature is stuck in.

Maybe the best thing to do is to figure out ways for food markets to smooth price increases over a longer period of time to reduce immediate pain and also subsidize technological investment to increase yields and efficiencies to increase competition.  Food production as a whole is a productive venture and it's worth investigating our options.  

On the housing side, zoning needs to be completely rethought, red tape needs to get cut down, and ownership structures on who/what can own what need to be recalibrated.  The real estate industry, with the exception of new construction, is economically unproductive, and increasing portions of the overall money supply being sent there will just lead to less efficient times and worse overall economic growth and stability.",0

"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)
The freedom of the press, protected by the First Amendment, is critical to a democracy in which the government is accountable to the people. A free media functions as a watchdog that can investigate and report on government wrongdoing. 

The ACLU  

Or 


The First Amendment

The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the public and press have a presumptive First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings in criminal cases, finding that a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448  U.S. 555, 573 (1980) (plurality opinion). It has not directly addressed whether the public and the press also have a constitutional right of access to civil proceedings, though six of the eight sitting justices at the time indicated that the right of public access would also apply to civil trials. Id. at 580 n. 17 (Burger, C.J.) (plurality opinion) (Whether the public has a right to attend trials of civil cases is a question not raised by this case, but we note that historically both civil and criminal trials have been presumptively open.); id. at 596 (Brennan, J., concurring) (referring to the value of open proceedings in civil cases); id. at 599 (Stewart, J., concurring) ([T]he First and Fourteenth Amendments clearly give the press and the public a right of access to trials themselves, civil as well as criminal.).

Every federal court of appeals to have considered whether the First Amendment guarantees a qualified right of access to civil trials and to their related proceedings and records has concluded that it does. N.Y.C.L.U. v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing Westmoreland v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 752 F.2d 16, 22 (2d Cir.1984);. Rushford v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 846 F.2d 249, 25354 (4th Cir.1988); In re Continental Ill. Secs. Litig., 732 F.2d 1302, 1308 (7th Cir. 1984); Publicker Indus., Inc. v. Cohen, 733 F.2d 1059, 1070 (3d Cir.1984); In re Iowa Freedom of Info. Council, 724 F.2d 658, 661 (8th Cir.1983); Newman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 796, 801 (11th Cir.1983)).

Some circuits have also recognized a constitutional right of access to court records, with one noting that the public and press have a [F]irst [A]mendment right of access to pretrial documents in general. Associated Press v. District Court, 705 F.2d 1143, 1145 (9th Cir. 1983). When considering whether a constitutional presumption of access applies to particular proceedings or records, courts apply the logic and experience test, also called the Press-Enterprise test. The test considers whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public, and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986) (citations omitted).

In addition to the constitutional right  and even where it does not apply  the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents. Nixon v. Warner Commcns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978) 

the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents. Nixon v. Warner Commcns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978) (footnote omitted). Indeed, the Third Circuit found that in both civil and criminal cases the existence of a common law right of access to & inspect judicial records is beyond dispute. Publicker Indus., Inc. v. Cohen, 733 F.2d 1059, 1066 (3rd Cir. 1984). Courts declining to extend a constitutional presumption of access to particular proceedings often likewise conclude that the proceedings are open by force of tradition. In re Krynicki, 983 F.2d 74, 75 (7th Cir. 1992).

What is the duty of the press in criminal cases? Those versed in the traditions of the law would answer this question by saying that since a crime is ""An act committed or omitted in violation of a public law forbidding or commanding it; a wrong which the government notices as injurious to the public, and punishes in what is called a criminal proceeding in its own name,"""" the guilt or innocence of one accused of an offense against the state should
be determined through utilization of time-tested criminal trial procedures, and the press should interfere with these procedures as little as possible.
That the press has a duty toward the public in handling news of criminal proceedings is undeniable, but this duty is a moral obligation or responsibility which always cannot be en- forced by law. That some sections of the press seek to discharge this obligation with a deep sense of responsibility to their readers is one of the main reasons for the continued success of democratic society. That other sections of the press do not handle criminal cases with appropriate moderation is equally obvious.
Freedom of the press is a right secured by the Constitution of the United States and protected by state constitutions.
Congress shall make no law .. .abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peacefully assemble....I
No law shall be passed impairing the freedom of speech; every person shall be free to speak, write or publish whatever he will on any subject, being responsible for all abuse of that liberty; and in all suits and prosecutions for libel the truth thereof may be given in evidence, and the jury, under the direction of the court, shall de- termine the law and the fact.,

That said, though, I'm still Anti-AA, not because of popular Republican opinions (even though I am Republican), but because I really don't think there's a place for AA in an equal-opportunity education system. Yes, diversity is good, and we SHOULD have more Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, females, LGBT, etc, in colleges, but I don't think that should come through diversity quotas or AA. I think legislative attention should be focused on fixing the core socioeconomic issues that prevent non-rich, white males from being accepted as often.",0

"Good question.A lot of people have a very simplistic view of what ""racism"" is.  They think that any recognition of race is racist.

But that is not correct.  Racism is about one race being advantaged over the other.  Superficially, that might mean that considering race in college enrollment might be giving one race an advantage, but its purpose is to level the playing field so that the dominant race will NOT have undue advantage.

The simple truth is, white people have an advantage in our society for a number of reasons.  This current atmosphere of ""anti-wokeness"" and opposition to affirmative action is clearly motivated by white people wanting to retain that advantage.

For perspective, I am a heterosexual white male, and it disgusts me to see other heterosexual white males acting like we are victims.",0

I mean who knows at the moment, but historically Putin has killed all of his political rivals. So if this wasnt some bizarre clown show orchestrated by Putin himself, either Prigozhin will go into permanent exile, or he will be eliminated. 

At the least its likely absolutely destroyed Russian military morale, IMO, confused in areas where Wagner was, the Russian battle space in Ukraine for a little while, and given the Ukrainians a slight reprieve - as well as ended Wagner as an entity. 

Thats my thoughts anyway, but then again I genuinely thought he would at least try and topple Putin, so now Im not certain of anything.",0

"russia in UN. russia takes over UN security council (hilarious...)

Dam collapses, both parties accuse each other, though we all know that even if russia hadn't blown up what was left of the dam (some are still suggesting it eroded because of the damage, but others claim this dam was built so sturdy it's unlikely), they caused the initial damage, damage that wouldn't have existed if they hadn't invaded in the first place, therefore russia is to blame.

Ukraine does everything possible to save as many people and animals as possible, requests aid from abroad even the UN. Gets shot several times (even now) with artillery

Russia: pulls out heavy infantry and vehicles, doesn't inform their light infantry, left them to die and uses them to blame Ukraine for the dam collapse. Does nothing for the people living there unless they have russian passports, doesn't even allow the UN in to help people, despite chairing the UN security council...

But don't you dare call it a genocide...

Like others have said both on here and on other social media sites (mostly twitter), russia knows they can't win this war, putin knows this but can't tell that to his country so he decides to throw as many russians into the meat grinder to cause as much harm to Ukraine in the process (soldiers dying while liberating their country, random shelling of villages, killing of local population,..)

According to a police report released by prosecutors, the driver of the Jaguar was able to steer around the protester's car and keep going.

&gt;After the crash Seattle police and Washington state police officers quickly located the suspected hit-and-run car and pulled it over, according to the report. The vehicle sustained heavy front-end damage and a shattered windshield, authorities said.

&gt;The Times reported that he wasnt impaired and said he worked until 10 p.m. at a family business. Kelete **drove at freeway speeds in lane one toward the barricade of three vehicles and continued driving at freeway speeds on the shoulder**, prosecutors alleged, according to The Times.

&gt;Before him were running pedestrians& **(Kelete) veered sharply left and directly into the protesters who were not able to run off the road**, the prosecution said, according to The Times.

In 2020 Kelete was charged with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving. His bail was initially $1.2 million and he faces up to 13 years in prison. He pled not guilty and I think he was in jail a little over six months before he bonded out and is now on home electronic monitoring until his trial.

Two, they are supposedly rapid aging the clones so that they can be harvested within the needed time frames. Who knows what kind of effect that would have on development.

Three, because of how the cellular machinery in bodies works, whenever something isn't used it atrophies. If the goal is to grow a healthy heart but the clone has spent it's whole life in a vat, the heart would be underdeveloped and likely not useful. Same with anything related to musculature.

"I dont think a lot of people realize the United States ended segregation (1964) and passed affirmative action (1965) at nearly the same time. Racism was so widespread and assumed that we literally needed to require businesses and schools to include non-white races to prove that theyre people too. If we never had affirmative action it wouldve been much more difficult to prove that businesses and the like were still discriminating. 

Fast forward to todays world and, while we still have racism, its nowhere near the levels it used to be. Were in this gray area of some people still discriminating and most people not, but now affirmative action is starting to become a problem because its function is still by definition racist. It was certainly needed at the time of inception but in modern society its much much much more accepted to have people of color in the work place. Remember, a year before inception, it was illegal for black people to drink from a white water fountain. 

I think affirmative action was great for its time, but society has grown and while it still has problems, affirmative action wont help with them. Its time for affirmative action to be thanked and laid to rest. Modern society has different problems with racism now that are more nuanced and require a different set of laws to deal with.",0

"Adding to u/ColoradoMonkeyPaw s comment: 

1) Its a huge red flag that he wants you to deal with him having sex with other people, but is not willing to offer you the same option. It should tell you that he holds you to a higher standard than he is willing to hold himself and demand more out of you from the relationship than he is willing to offer. 

2) If it really was just sexual release your boyfriend needed, he could achieve that with masturbation. The reason we want sex with other people is because there is a difference between solo sex and sex when it involves someone else, and a whole lot of that are feelings like validation, and affection. 

3) Nursing school is demanding. That youre going away for it means you will be away from your current social network. Theyll keep in touch, but that will make a difference. Do you really want to add the stress of your boyfriend sleeping around to that? 

And believe me, I say this as someone who really enjoys the open relationship I have. It is not unreasonable for you to want monogamy. It is also unreasonable for you to want a partner who offers you as much as he expects from you. 

Best of luck in your professional and personal pursuits!",0

"Personally, I wouldn't read toooo much into it, but do be a little cautious. It's pretty common to positively reinforce certain behaviours in partners and even friends/family, although most of the time it's probably not a conscious thing. I definitely overly compliment my boyfriend when he's wearing clothes that I like. It's not intended to be manipulative and certainly not malicious, but I definitely want to encourage him to branch out from sweatpants and old t-shirts. I'm sure your partner wasn't intending to come across like that, but I totally see why it would make you uncomfortable- he basically insulted your old style and then claimed that your new style was his responsibility, which is a bit of a mind bender. 

If I were you I'd talk to him about it and communicate that even though you're sure he didn't mean it to be malicious, it actually made you feel uncomfortable and a little hurt. If he's as good as you say he is, your feelings should change his perspective on purposely using those kinds of tactics again. I don't think he was necessarily wrong per se, but definitely insensitive when talking about it and just lacks a bit of awareness of how it may have made you feel.",0

"Reality is a team sport, to some people. 

Conservatism is hierarchy. There is no other force in that moral universe. 

This is why every argument you have with these people is frustrating nonsense. They don't have a consistent set of beliefs you can interact with. They have slogans. 

What's true today is handed down by people above you, and if they belong above you, they must be better than you. In every way. Because there's only the one metric. Someone clever can't just be wrong, since that would require an objective means to evaluate claims. That is not what claims are for, in this default tribal worldview. They can only be accepted or rejected based on interpersonal trust. 

You perform loyalty by finding whatever sequence of words might justify the latest conclusion. Consistency means less than nothing. It's an obstacle to making good moves in this word game. You don't use the same words as yesterday for the same reason you don't make the same moves in two rounds of poker. You shuffle your cards and play whatever's likely to work.

"The basic idea is to discourage people from getting puppies from ""pet shops"" since many of those puppies are from puppy mills. A puppy mill is a place that doesn't give a damn about the dogs there, they just see them as a means to an end where the dogs live in terrible conditions (often getting injured or sick along the way) and are constantly churning out new puppies.

The ""adopt"" part is to encourage people to go to shelters and places like that to take in dogs who've been rescued or come from broken homes.

Where this all goes awry is when it becomes more about ""social currency"" to the point where some people attempt to shame and/or verbally attack those who don't agree with them and only go to shelters. Most of these people can't (or won't) understand the difference between a reputable breeder and a puppy mill because to them it's become almost a semi-religious belief system.

You might ask, ""Why wouldn't you go to a shelter?"" Well, lots of reasons. Some people want a specific breed for specific purposes. Some breeds are naturally better at certain jobs and some breeds are predisposed to being better with kids and families than others.

Additionally, some people (like myself) are extremely allergic to dogs that have fur and need to have a dog that has hair instead. This severely limits which breeds I can be around for any length of time and of those breeds  such as poodles, irish water spaniels, portuguese water dogs, or lagotto romagnolos  I have never seen any of them at any shelter or SPCA.

Yet I've still had people verbally assault me for daring to get a dog that ""works for me"" because I'm apparently ""being selfish"" by thinking of myself first. All of this ignores the fact that I couldn't keep a dog I literally have severe allergic reactions to that also trigger my asthma, but I guess I'm supposed to suffer or just never have a dog.

As you can see, some of these people are, for lack of a better term, completely nuts. If they could get away with violence, I imagine some of them would definitely do so.

Fortunately, most people who go by ""adopt, don't shop"" are sane and understand that there's nothing wrong with getting a dog from a reputable breeder (which is NOT the same thing as a puppy mill) so long as you avoid pet stores and puppy mills themselves.",0

You guys are still trying to figure out sex and pleasure, they are two different things. We spend a lot of our time just getting to the point; kiss a bit, touch each other for a bit, do some oral on each other then PIV and finish. Thats vanilla, thats predictable, thats not playful. 

You might need to learn how to slow things down, how to tease him, how to build up to those exciting points during sex rather than just doing the main events. For example, have you ever blindfolded him, kissed his entire body slowly and then ended by kissing around his balls and cock without actually performing oral? Do you play with maintaining eye contact during PIV? Have you ever tried dirty talking?

I highly recommend you start talking about sex, the fact that he shuts down about it is not a good omen for your sex life.

"There are 3 primary forms of mass shooting in the United States.

* Familicide / family violence
* Felony shootings
* Random spree shootings

The first two are the most common, and depending on the source, one or the other is the most common.

Familicide/family violence is where a person, usually the male head of household, kills his family.  Usually there is a history of domestic violence.

Felony shootings are mass shootings that happen in conjunction with some other criminal objective.  These are often related to gang or organized crime.

The last kind - random spree shootings, are the least common, but the most highly sensationalized.  

The good news is you can largely determine if you will ever be a victim of the most common kinds of mass shootings.  If you don't associate with domestic abusers, people who abuse drugs or alcohol, or people who have past or present criminal behavior, then you are unlikely to ever be a victim of the first two kinds of mass shooting.

Random spree shootings are so rare you have about the same odds of being struck by lightning as dying in a random spree shooting.",0

"&gt;Seriously; you are bringing up Geneva convention in defense of Russia ? Maybe start by reading the Geneva conventions ?

Oh I actually did, instead of just posting the link to the title Wikipedia page.

&gt;Collective punishment is a punishment or sanction imposed on a group for acts allegedly perpetrated by a member of that group, which could be an ethnic or political group, or just the family, friends and neighbors of the perpetrator. Because individuals who are not responsible for the wrong acts are targeted, collective punishment is not compatible with the basic principle of individual responsibility. The punished group may often have no direct association with the perpetrator other than living in the same area and can not be assumed to exercise control over the perpetrator's actions. Collective punishment is prohibited by treaty in both international and non-international armed conflicts, more specifically Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II

&amp;#x200B;

Sanction imposed on a group for actions allegedly(!) perpetrated by a member of that group. Are you grasping the basics at this point?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;US, EU, UN and others know that they are unable to comprehend international law and are violating something.

There are targeted sanctions to stop the war, which are fine. And then there are sanctions aimed and running the careers of random people, or banning people who have got nothing to do with the war from opening bank accounts, and so on. Which would be a violation of the international - law, if it existed.

If the racists and bigots win, they will take revenge. If the good people win, we'll hold the most directly responsible accountable, but will we have the resolve to look our parents in the eyes and tell them they get no quarter just because they were brainwashed by fox News? I don't think so.

The strong and unrepentant will always eventually win out over the forgiving, and while that may be somewhat tragic, I don't think I would trade humanity to join the side of the strong and unrepentant.

Edit: a lot of folks don't get what I mean here. I'm saying if we want to purge the worst of people, we have to be the worst of people. It's not a worthwhile thing to strive for.

"&gt; But on the state level, Florida gets hit by hurricanes EVERY YEAR.

Completely incorrect.

&gt;How often does Florida get hurricanes? According to Best Places Florida is affected by a tropical storm or hurricane about once every 3 years. Recently Southwest Florida has been hit by a major storm once about every 5 years. These included Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Ian in 2022

Most years, Florida actually doesn't get hit with a hurricane.  Many years, they don't even get Tropical Storms.  

&gt;That needs to just be part of the cost of living in Florida. Either save more money to deal with damage, or spend more money up front making buildings and infrastructure more weather resistant

People do both.

But, what about all the other states that get hit with hurricanes.  What about Puerto Rico?

Do you want them to not get Federal aid as well?

&gt;a town hit hard by a tornado can expect disaster money from the state, because taking a direct hit from a major tornado is an extremely rare event

But it's not....it's pretty common in states that have good conditions for tornados on a regular basis.  I mean, why else would towns in the mid-west have fucking TORNADO SIRENS!!!! I mean.... ""Oh, we're going to have these sirens on the RARE event that there is a tornado...and you are never going to hear them, because it's so rare....""  

Yeah....Ok.....

&gt;not just forseeable but are actually expected, and disasters that were not foreseeable.

So....Tornados are expected, so they should get reduced federal aid, because the land/weather conditions are known to produce them, people living in those areas should expect them.

We know that earthquates happen along fault lines, so anyone living on the West coast should expect them.

WE know that fracking causes earthquakes, so anyone living in an area with oil/natural gas should expect them as well...

They had purchased a former roller skating rink to use as a building, so no windows or natural light, the walls and ceilings were black, and the floor was polished concrete. It felt like you were walking into a cave when you walked in and it was so dark. The only changes they made were that they hung up random areas of unpainted drywall and cubicles to try to portion the different classrooms off. No soundproofing, and it was grades K-3, so it was just constant noise. No playground or park for the kids to play outside either, so recess was just them playing quietly in their classrooms. Ha.

"That particular aspect of the rule is quite unlikely to be used in this case because it is otherwise factually fairly narrow. 

A motion to dismiss at the close of evidence under rule 29 is effectively asking the court to rule that the prosecution's case is fatally flawed in some way. 

For example, the prosecutor failed to put on a witness that could identify the defendant in a robbery case or the prosecutor failed to offer lab testimony proving that the powder seized from the defendant was actually drugs. That level of fatal.  

The state cannot appeal that dismissal because the state cannot fuck up the trial and then ask for a second chance. 

But that rule is so narrow and if a judge used that rule to dismiss a case as part of a corrupt bargain, you would probably see some sort of extraordinary relief being sought by the government.

There are so many other ways that a judge who is in the tank for Trump could affect the proceedings with minimal risk of an appeal that that is just really unlikely to happen. 

If the case stays in front of Judge cannon, here is what I do think is fairly likely. 

1.  The timing of the case will be bent in whatever manner seems favorable to trump.  It is likely to get dragged out.

 2.   Defense Counsel motions, no matter how outwardly silly, will be treated with absolute seriousness.  The government will be given the full statutory time to respond and the judge will schedule Hearing in the due course of time. 

3.  The thumb will be on the scale as far as the admissibility of evidence. She may let Trump make arguments in the defense that other judges with bar from being in front of the jury. It's possible she may keep the prosecutor from making similar arguments. 

Anything above is up to the discretion of the judge. So it's difficult to appeal. 

Finally, the nightmare scenario is that Trump is convicted and she simply holds a sentencing Hearing and lets trump off with nearly no punishment. 

That is appealable, but caselaw establishes a LOT of discretion for judges to deviate from sentencing guidelines.",0

This way, you aren't alienating the neighbor, while recruiting the lawn company customer to your side.
The company won't want to risk losing a customer,  nor do they wish to incur reputational damage.

"&gt; What people need to understand is that if Putin's regime does collapse, we need to help Russia rebuild and build a democratic government. 

What you need to understand is that we just finished going through a $2,000,000,000,000 experiment on building a country out of people desperate not to be a country. We *don't* need to do the same for Russia. We just need to play ""catch the nuke"" and make sure that whatever states happen to fall out of the breakup of Russia doesn't become the *next* Russia.

This was the outcome I had expected from this war from the jump, to be completely honest here. I predicted they'd fail at the war, a civil war would break out, and Russia would imminently collapse into post-Russia states as ethnic groups pulled away from the Russian Federation and asserted their own statehood.

The *best* we can do is make sure we don't end up replaying the same game again in 40-50 years. The worst possible idea is for NATO to roll in and pretend we can fix them, because that shit ain't fixable - they're going to have to figure that shit out for themselves.",0

You need to deal with that. Why didnt he?",0
"Yes humans are flawed but humans also have a conscience and ability to recognise the wrongness of their actions. Very rarely can cheating be seen in good light (apart from instances where intimate partner violence is in play). This begs the question, why do people cheat?

Often it's for their own personal gain (e.g., proving to themselves their value in the eyes of others, having a stable home and finances if their partner is wealthy, maintaining custody of children etc...).

Furthermore, there is an issue with your argument for social constructs. A social construct is not fixed and you do not have to abide by it. Unless suggested otherwise, a relationship should be assumed to be monogamous. If you really want to ""cheat"" then perhaps you should've made your intentions clearer so that you can get away with cheating on your partner and just label it a polyamory.

So yes, humans are flawed but this doesn't excuse cheating and doesn't take away from the fact that a wrong action is wrong; cheaters are conscious of this fact yet still do it. 

Honestly, it really doesn't take that much spine to break up with someone if it's the right thing to do. Only selfish and greedy people would stay for the comfort of a relationship. Cheaters are just that, selfish and greedy cowards.

The effects of being cheated on is honestly one of the most awful feelings that I would not wish on anyone, not even the person who cheated on me. There's this person you love who you think loves you but their heart is being shared about. The aftermath of cheating is a real psychological mess that nothing could prepare you for and the hurt caused by cheating should alone be enough to convince one of its wrongness.",0

1) They think that they are smarter than everyone else, but...

2) They are not

One thing we know about this case is that there are still ongoing investigations. In other words, not all of the shoes have dropped yet. It would not surprise me in the slightest if additional charges were applied to trump, and that evidence to support those charges draws upon information extracted from the photocopier.

"&gt; Responsibility for exercising the pardon power vested in the President by Article II, section 2, of the Constitution was shared by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General from 1789-1853. The Attorney General had administrative responsibility for pardon application review, 1853-70, although the Department of State continued to issue pardon warrants until a Presidential order of June 6, 1893, transferred this function to the Department of Justice. Pardon responsibilities were delegated to the Office of the Clerk of Pardons, established in the Office of the Attorney General by an act of March 3, 1865 (13 Stat. 516). The Office of the Clerk of Pardons became a component of the newly created Department of Justice, pursuant to its enabling act, June 22, 1870 (16 Stat. 162). It was superseded by the Office of the Attorney in Charge of Pardons, established in the Department of Justice by an act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 946), and re-designated the Office of the Pardon Attorney in 1894.

Only one person needs to want out for the marriage to end. So unfortunately how you feel about it is not relevant. She wants out. That's it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What can I do? I'm just lost right now.

Your responsibilities as a father remain vitally important. Don't let those slip because of the separation. Make every effort to ensure your child feels loved and safe. Make a clear, written agreement with your wife about child custody, paying for the child's needs etc.

Emotionally, it's going to suck hard. Marital breakdown is one of the most stressful things anyone can go through. Especially when you're not the one initiating the divorce. If you're struggling, keep up with therapy - they can give you the tools you need to manage your feelings.

Stay off booze and drugs. They're a tempting salve for heartbreak but they just make everything worse.

Look after yourself. Try to eat healthily. Exercise. Being sad is no reason to let your body go to shit. Especially as you're recovering from serious illness.

&gt;How do I get myself reinvolved in the world? I've looked at some dating apps but they just seem so shallow and superficial. I don't want to make small talk with anyone, let alone initiate a relationship with another woman.

So don't date. It's way too fresh and raw. Any woman you got involved with now would be a rebound. It wouldn't be fair on her and wouldn't really help. The only thing that helps is time.  Don't worry about dating for now. For now focus on your own wellbeing and that of your child.",0

"A summary of the short story: 

in 2012 the Iranian Air Force intercepted a US MQ-1 (Predator) drone flying in international waters off the coast of Iran. Iran sent 2 planes to intercept. They attempted to shoot it down using on-board guns, but the planes were Russian Frogfoots that weren't intended for air-air, and so they were ineffective, ultimately turning back and the Predator drone landed without damage. But the message was sent - Iran was willing to shoot down drones *near* their country. 

in 2013 the US sent another MQ-1 drone in the similar area. Knowing what happened last time, this time they sent it with escort. As expected, 2 planes flew to intercept the drone, except this time it was two F4 phantoms, capable of Air-to-Air engagement. as Iran closed in on the drone, the 2 Escorts, a pair of F-22 Raptors moved in. As they closed, the lead pilot flew directly underneath the F4 Phantoms, having made the distance completely undetected by Iran. 

After a look up at the missiles loaded on the F4 Phantoms, the lead pilot swung left, and formed up on the wing of the lead Phantom. He then opened his radio, and informed them ""you really ought to go home.""

according to the F-22 pilot, the 2 Phantoms quickly complied.",0

"&gt;Also are you in the UK antitrust regulator's office?

I think my response made it pretty clear I'm not. I don't know much about their system, but get the impression they stop mergers more often than the US. They may very well stick their initial decision on this, but it just seems unlikely that would be enough to completely stop it. Who knows, maybe not.

&gt;Are you an anti-trust lawyer?

No. I don't think my response sounded very lawyerly myself. More like a random nobody on the internet, which is what I am.

&gt;What is all your doubt founded on?

The actual history of anti-trust laws in the US. Just check out [this section on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law#Rise_of_the_Chicago_School_(1970s%E2%80%93present)), if you are interested. A really good explanation is [Planet Money's three episodes](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/03/20/704426033/antitrust-in-america) about current anti-trust laws.

And then there's just the lack of major mergers that actually get stopped. You hear about them going through all the time, and you almost never hear about ones that actually get stopped. And then the actual case history has been very against stopping mergers, and SCOTUS is now very clearly pro-business. Sounds like the FTC is headed in a more anti-trust route, but the FTC can't overturn court decisions, so I'm not sure that ends up making a big difference.

I'm not claiming to be an expert or something. I'm throwing out my opinion because the topic interests me. I'll gladly consider any actual argument you might have or any links that describe the reasons why this might actually get stopped.

"&gt;How often does Pelosi vote with Progressives?

1. She *is* a progressive.
2. She's in the top 40 most left-voting Democrats in the House. Far to the left of Adam Schiff (who is, himself, to the left of Katie Porter). About equal to Tammy Baldwin, who is clearly a progressive.
3. On specifically progressive issues, ProgressivePunch gives her an [""A"" rating](https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=house), voting with progressive issues over 10% more often as expected given her district's partisan lean (meaning she's more progressive than her own constituents). Her percent voting in line with progressive issues on crucial votes (meaning votes where the result was close) is almost equal to Bernie Sanders's.

&gt;The majority of Democrats receive corporate funding

That doesn't mean anything. Liz Warren (whose voting record as analyzed by Voteview is the furthest left record in Congress by a significant margin and whose record on progressive issues as analyzed by Progressive Punch puts her #4 in the Senate behind only Peter Welch, Alex Padilla, and Ed Markey) has the right take on this. Like it or not, corporate donations are a part of the system. The best way to get power is to take advantage of that. And you can't get rid of corporate money in politics until you have power.

In order to change the system, you have to operate within it. And she demonstrates the fact that taking corporate money doesn't mean you have to vote against progressive values, and it certainly doesn't make you a ""corporatist.""

&gt;and pass policy that helps corporations

Any policy that helps workers helps corporations. Pro-union legislation helps corporations because satisfied workers are productive workers. By your logic, anyone who votes to help unions is ""corporate."" You would equate a social democrat like Warren with a corrupt anti-worker extremist like Ted Cruz.

"Uranium is constantly decaying, releasing radiation in the process. If you put enough radioactive material together there's enough radiation to cause a chain reaction of radiation hitting other atoms, making them emit more radiation, hitting more atoms. This is called a critical mass.

The difficulty of making a nuclear bomb is about getting enough U-235 to form a critical mass. Separating unstable uranium from stable uranium is very difficult. You need like 85% pure U-235 to make a bomb but its natural occurence is 0.8% U-235 and 99% U-238.

When you've got enough uranium you just store it as two sub-critical masses and then smash the two together when you want it to explode.",0

Trudeau was also 43 when sworn as the Prime Minister of Canada.

Becoming a powerful political leader at a young age who drives change is certainly possible.

But instead of that shes pulling these stunts which politicians and powerful of the world forget about in a week or so. Totally ineffective.

Advocating is ineffective. It wont achieve much. It never did. The system can only be changed from within - by hardline politicians who lobby for sustainability.

Some weeks ago, I was curious why it seemed like there were way more MtFs than FtMs. To me, it was kinda proof that being male today is worse than being male. Why would there be more MtFs then?

I ended up I think on r/asktransgender at a thread about the topic. The replies from really the only sources with the expertise and proper perspective so I tend to trust their answer.

They said numbers are basically equal. Its just easier for FtMs to blend in and go unnoticed in society than it is for MtFs. Additionally, women have the impossible beauty standards thing in society.

Just for general context, banging sounds underwater can happen for a myriad of reasons. Hell, some dolphins, shrimp and crabs can sound mechanical underwater. 

The buoys that P8s, etc drop can pick up the noise of hammers on a hull, but it's very difficult to discern it from other noises in the water. 

I think people should not get hung up on banging noises underwater as it gives the wrong impression of what this passive sonar search is like. The ocean is incredibly loud and is filled with sounds emanating from thousands of nautical miles away from biological, environmental, and manmade sources.

For starters, he doesn't seem to have the same goal as you: you want to move in together independently, he wants to continue living with his family because it's comfortable for him. Neither of you are in the wrong about that, but you both want different things for the future.  


The other big, gigantic thing you should consider, is that he's not used to doing household chores and probably wasn't even taught how to do them. Is he open to learning, and does he understand that he absolutely must be an equal partner and that means sharing chores? Unless your goal is to be a traditional housewife, which is absolutely great if that's what you really want in life... you'll end up working full time and then coming home to be maid full time and cook full time, while he doesn't do any of those tasks. And soon you'll resent him for that and you'll be unhappy on a daily basis and feeling disrespected and unloved because he doesn't want you to be his equal, he wants to be serviced and give nothing in return. Again, if your goal is to stop working and he will support you both financially and your contribution will be taking care of the house, it's fine, that's balanced, but what wouldn't be balanced is you having zero free time and he having all the free time after work.

A) Canada has no centralized national firefighting agency, just provincial.

B) Canadas forest service was cut from 2,200 to just 700 workers in the 1990s by Paul Martin (then finance minister). The brain drain has caused a lot of harm, and even with the economy there improving since they havent been given the same resources they used to have

C) the biggest one. No prescribed burns. They put out any natural fires they can, and it leaves leaf litter and deadwood to accumulate on the forest floor. All it takes is one lighting strike and it becomes a massive blanket of easy kindling. Prescribed burns would prevent this, but because people have been NIMBY about it and theres no national service the approval process with local government is so strenuous the window is likely to pass before any can be done even in private land. 

Their efficacy was proven by Canadian wildfires actually, First Nation communities following cultural practices which are in essence primitive forms of the modern burning techniques remained largely untouched whereas other towns hit by the same wild fires were deleted.

What needs to happen is this has to result in pressure demanding funding for the forest service, a national fire control agency, and the ability to do regular controlled burns without local government being able to stonewall it",0

No judgments usually but we three all knew my brother to be an addict. When he went outside it turned out hed had his coke dealer drop off to him. He had it, ran out, then wouldnt stop making the entire afternoon about scoring more. We were fuming. 

We confronted him and said that we werent happy about him having it and that his obsession with trying to steer the night in a way thatd be less fun for us just to get more wasnt going to fly. We have him a choice: stop or wed send him home in a taxi.

He agreed to stop texting dealers. Less than 5 minutes later he went out for a cigarette, we followed him out of suspicion. Lo and behold, hes on the phone to a dealer. His friend grabs his phone and we close ranks, saying he can have it back either when we leave or, if he cant get a grip, when the taxi arrives. 

Youve never seen a tantrum like it. This fully grown man was dragging fence panels off in the beer garden, screaming and crying that we were ruining his life, trying to swing for us. In the end we had to make excuses for his behaviour, restrain him and leave.",0

"&gt;  Russia is not The Soviet Union

It depends. Russia inherited its debts. It inherited its place on the UN security council. Many of the same people who were in the upper echelons of power in the Russian SSR kept comparable positions in the newly formed RF, so there were many organs of the state which basically rebranded and otherwise continued what they were doing.  

As far as most of the world is concerned, including the West 90% of the time, the central government of the Soviet Union and the Russian government can be seen as two phases of the same entity.   

Only when it is inconvenient to us, do we pretend they are two *totally different* things. India insofar as they view Russia positively, do so because they still see them as being the same entity as the Soviet Union.",0

That also doesn't mean there won't be additional emotional cuts both ways as you figure out the new dynamic. He broke your trust and everyone gets cut by the sharp edges in picking up the pieces.
3. Don't keep the kids apart. You need to figure out how that coordination will work. Don't take it out on the children.

Honestly, Im not a huge fan of the fact that a service member basically has to tell their chain of command to utilize this, but its probably the quickest, best solution to the rapidly changing geography of abortion access across the country.

Personally, I think SecDef Austin should call him on his bluff. Remove the policy that allows for paid travel out of state for abortion access, but institute a new policy that allows service members to refuse orders to duty stations in states without adequate abortion access. Then when every service member in Texas and Florida are requesting transfers we can tell everyone to thank Tuberville for protecting tax payers",0

"People like to point out that you're wrong, but the fact is that no preventative pardon, which violates the letter and spirit of the presidential pardon power, has been challenged in court, and you are absolutely correct that the power is written to be after conviction and acceptance that you committed the crime as convicted. It's supposed to be for a check against political prisoners and to allow a president to act in good faith to release a convict who they believe either shouldn't be punished the way they are, or that the law should be changed because of its scope or application. While I do feel that they are very rarely a good thing, allowing it unchecked is basically tantamount to saying as long as you do it for the president, you're never going to be held to account for anything.

Nixon should have rotted in prison, we wouldn't be where we are today if he hadn't been treated like a child that took a cookie from the jar.

At any rate, to answer OP's question, this is all basically a paperwork technicality.  The office of the president alone has the authority to declassify anything it wants.  Not the vice president, not the secretary of state, and so that's why what Biden and Hillary did was substantially worse, and why the fact that they aren't being charged with anything makes it blatantly obvious to anyone that this is nothing but a politically motivated witch hunt for the sole purpose of removing a political rival.",0

"I feel like it's more than that. I think it's a reaction to Obama, because it stirred up all the underlying racism and muslim hatred brewing in this country. He's not muslim, but when did that ever matter? The seed was planted and it grew. The other part of it was Sarah Palin's sudden popularity, which can only be described as conservative milf obsession, because she was objectively dumb as hell and absolutely batshit crazy. They overlooked it all because she had 'charisma' and that was soon seen as a success within the party. So finding more Sarah Palins with attitude over competence became the goal. 

The reaction to all this? The Tea Party. And sweet mercy was that a tsunami of crazy bullshit. It was the populist, nationalist pot boiling over that Newt Gingrich had wanted all along. It was effective and it was commandeered wholesale by the GOP, but it also completely consumed the GOP as well. 

Now the party is overrrun with Matt Gaetz and MTG and Boebert types, who are all turd-flinging monkeys from the zoo. Their only strategy is to whoop and scream and cause a fuss. But as long as the message vaguely, sorta vibes with conservatives, they can say whatever the fuck falls out of their skulls. The party is completely off the rails now. The lunatics are running the asylum. 

I know somewhere within all this the russians had some part to play. We've seen Putin's hand on the scale too many times within the GOP and abroad. France, UK, Spain, Italy, Brazil, if there were hardline right-wingers running for office or pushing shit like Brexit over the past twenty years, they were always suspiciously supportive of Putin. Like, weirdly obsessive about him. Plus they would also call for the dissolution of NATO and other nuclear treaties, etc. Trump also spoke about withdrawing from NATO. He tried to hobble Ukraine with blackmail and withdrawing support. He benefitted from direct election interference from Russia. I don't think this is coincidence at all. 

I don't know what it will take to actually stop this madness. If Trump is in jail, that's a tiny piece of it. If Putin gets thrown out a window, that's another tiny piece of it. But we're still looking at the end result of a snowball effect here. It's much bigger now than any of its individual causes.",0

"&gt;I am sure there is a huge difference to OP from her bf hugging his ex after his ex makes it known she has 0 respect for the new relationship &amp; him hugging a friend that also happens to be a girl.

While that is true, I've seen it so often go further like that. In fact, every single time I have seen something like this irl, it has gone that far. And it has happened A LOT. So I kinda do get that assumption a lot of the time, and in this context it is something that I would see as very probable. Both for older couples and younger couples, I've seen both in these situations a lot.

&gt;He also didn't have to brush OP off while comforting his ex.

Well, yes and no. While he did brush off OP, I am able to understand that. I know this isn't the exact situation, but if you were to have a friend who is having some kind of troubles in life and just wants someone to talk to and to hug, and your partner came over to stop you from doing so, would you feel a bit disrespected? I know I would. It just shows that OP doesn't trust him to not go too far. And while he could have just said something to OP instead of pushing her away, he could have just been panicking a bit. Either because of what it looks like to OP (because of the cheating normalizing society we seem to be), or because of what the ex told him. So thinking completely straight may have not been too easy and he could have acted impulsively and protectively. Which, once again, is understandable. Even if it was someone you didn't like too much, it's part of our biology to care for each other. So his instincts were maybe kind of in the way, I don't really know. But you would be somewhat correct with pointing this out.

&gt;he could at least stand up for his girlfriend when his ex makes weird remarks like that.

This doesn't work very often. It won't change the friend group talking with the ex and keeping her as a big part of the group. And that is the largest issue here, the ex's impact on the whole group. Which can't be just shoved away by standing up, sadly.

&gt;I also never said they should just break up,

I don't think I ever said you did? At least I didn't mean to say that you would have said or meant that at any point. I am sorry if you misunderstood it. I was just saying that I don't like the fact that most of this community always goes straight to telling OP to break up in practically any post, with big or small issues in the relationship.

&gt;obviously you should talk about the issues and how to solve them first, but eventually the ex is just going to keep wearing down their relationship anyways if once again the boyfriend doesn't at least put a stop to the way ex talks about her.

I agree with you here. But as I already said, that is difficult. Just standing up to the ex won't change much, she still has the rest of the group. And that was what she was doing at the start. Talking bad about her to the rest of the group (summarizing it all by saying that). So the whole group has to have a discussion about this, either with the ex being there or not. That would be a better idea in my opinion than just standing up and being ""negative"" towards the ex out of nowhere",0

"I personally was cheated on in a 7 year relationship. We were each others first relationship and lost our virginity to each other. Also worth noting that she was raised in a strict religious environment and was underdeveloped in multiple ways because of it. 

At the end of the day I had my own mental issues that went unresolved for years, and it made her bitter and resentful of me as I did not take ownership of my problems. A rift was created between us, she connected with other people and finally began to develop in ways her youth had robbed her of, moved away from religion and developed a thirst for novelty and new experiences (understandably), and distanced herself from me. I sensed this, finally began changing, but it was too late and the resentment ran too deep. She was eager for new things, but was not emotionally mature enough to end things between us due to our longstanding relationship. So, she cheated with a dude while she was on a work trip. 

At the end of the day, is she still wrong? Yes, absolutely, but there are a lot of complex emotions involved and its usually never as simple as people make it seem.",0

"Yes, SSRIs do technically increase serotonin levels immediate, but the immediate increase is not nearly as significant as the surge seen with illicit drugs like cocaine or MDMA. 


Additionally, the mechanism of action plays a large role in this. If you dont know, the term Mechanism of Action refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect. 


It can be difficult to wrap your head around this concept without a fundamental understanding of chemistry/medicine, but to put it simply, drugs like cocaine and MDMA cause a quick and powerful increase in the amount of serotonin in the brain. They work by directly affecting the release and reuptake of serotonin. They make the brain release a lot of serotonin all at once, flooding the brain with a large amount of this chemical. 


Whereas SSRIs work by helping the brain keep serotonin around for longer. Normally, after serotonin does its job, it gets taken back up into the brain cells through a process called reuptake. But SSRIs block this reuptake (SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). So the serotonin stays in the spaces between the brain cells for a bit longer. This allows the serotonin to keep sending its messages and potentially help improve our mood over time.

2. Part of it may also be lack of rebellion. Like things have changed a lot. When i went to high school, we were still 'scared' of teachers. Not scared scared, but like it was there. Ditto for our parents. So you kind of needed to rebel by being out there and doing shit.
3. I think a lot of the fun of drinking is the activities that you do on it. Like, we used to drink and go the clubs and stuff. But our mind was pretty free in terms of we just going to have a good time. We didn't really think twice about consent. It was basically if you forcing it like rape rape, you were good. Kids today probably do. Along similar lines, fights were common and that is probably less today.
4. Social media and being caught doing stupid stuff when drunk. Like I don't know how kids even live these days. You can't even make mistakes anymore.",0

"I'll come out of the wordwork to tell you that you're being disengenious at best.  From someone who actually knows people who work in the railroads.  This is a small concession compared to what most were willing to strike over.

Did Biden admin likely do leaps and bounds better than a Trump admin would have?  Of course, anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking idiot.

But, if you think this is what the union membership wanted to strike over you're pretty close to as much of a useful idiot as those folks.  4 days of paid sick leave for only portions of various crafts is near-useless, and not what anyone asked for.  They were asking for the ability to take sick leave when actually sick.  This was not negotiated for, and you still must schedule your sick leave in advance or be written up.

In no real way was the railroading 'deal' a win for workers.  At best you can say the Biden admin allowed the workers to just tread water vs. being actively pushed under like before.  Railroading is still a shit career with zero work/life balance.  A portion of the workforce got a 4 day a year raise, is what this is.  Nice, but certainly not ""sick days"" as most people think of them.  Use them as such and you'll eventually be fired.

The constant spinning gets tiresome.  This was not some huge epic win, it was a small movement in the right direction which likely was going to happen either way due to massive ongoing attrition in the workforce.",0

"Obviously I'm just a stranger on the Internet who has no clue who you and your dad are, however I read that as a sad lament on how he feels guilty that he couldn't give you the very best of everything because you deserve it.


I have children myself and while I'm by no means living in poverty, I still can't give my children every wonderful thing they deserve, and not a day goes by where I don't feel terrible about it. My kids are amazing and deserve so many things that I just can't give.


I think that's the place where your dad is coming from. He loves you so much but feels like he's let you down because he couldn't give you everything you deserved and he feels guilty about it.

"His narcissistic egomania and criminal conspiracies are two different things. 

He doesn't rip off and extort people and governments because of his narcissism or ego, he does it because is a career criminal conman who engages in far more actual conspiracies than fake conspiracy theories he pushes.

He doesn't think he actually lost the election. Stone and [Bannon bragged](https://youtu.be/OxNoUnxN_cs) that he was going to do this. He himself spent months trying to demonize mail-in voting. It was all a scheme, from claiming victory on election night to the fake electors, to pressuring officials, to starting a deadly riot when all other aspects of his coup failed.

And this is far from the first or last instance of his obvious criminality, so I'm really getting tired of that being excused as ""mental illness"" just because he doesn't think the rules apply to him.

He doesn't believe his bullshit. I mean, are you kidding me!?! Right here, he told the truth in private in that recording, but once caught he goes to lying, making up all sorts of different excuses. That's not mental illness, it's typical behavior of a liar and criminal.

similarly, OPs gf needs to put the loads of laundry together. again, to save water and the planet. unless the machine was full, which is an unmentioned factor. or if they require different wash cycles. some info is missing on the reasoning behind separating the laundry.

and finally, OP you may be a people pleaser. you reach out to help your gf when she needs it, and assume she will do the same for you. this is actually a toxic mentality on your part, and not a sign anything is inherently off with your relationship. you gotta work on that co-dependency.

Halo effects arent real, its referred to often as putting someone on a pedestal, and that isnt how long term relationships work, as eventually youll see your partner for who they really are.

Are you seeing him for who he really is and not liking it?  Is him having faults in general the problem, or is it specifically the faults he has (which likely goes beyond this incident)?  Like, this happened a long time ago and after it you decided to actually get together and get engaged, is this jitters or what?  Because after paying attention to the end of your post, it seems youre focusing on this incident, but there may be a lot more to it than that because your actions say that you felt pretty strongly for him after this incident (you got back with him and are engaged) even if you are saying now you didnt&.something else may be at play here.",0

"This wasnt libel. 

The dominion lawsuit is completely different from this situation.

Thats defamation and Im all for suing the shit out of someone for that. 

I dont agree with the statements made by Fox in regards to Biden whatsoever but its not libel and I think its entirely crazy to think that it is and screech about taking legal action. 

Im not defending Fox News. I hate Fox News as much as anyone, but you cant just sue someone for saying something you dont like.

"Universities almost always have more qualified applicants than seats. Affirmative Action just ensures that the demographics of the selected applicants are similar to the demographics of the qualified applicants as a whole. If 20% of the qualified applicants are black, but only 10% of selected applicants are black, then the university had some underlying bias against black applicants in its selection process.

Systemic Racism is tricky because something needs to break the cycle for it to end. Black families were barred from moving out of urban ghettos until the 1960s. The public schools there receive less funding since school funding is sourced locally in the US. With poverty and worse education, crime is higher. Due to higher crime, police patrol their neighborhoods more, which further inflates felonies and prison sentences. Getting a felony makes it harder to get a job, which makes it harder to move out of the ghetto, which makes it harder for their kids to get a good education, which means after all this time, black families often stay in these underperforming, poverty-stricken areas.

So where do we break the cycle? We can stop over-patrolling their neighborhoods. We can stop banning low-cost housing outside the ghetto with Exclusionary Zoning (which is a policy intentionally crafted to keep minorities out of white neighborhoods). And when the time comes that some students beat the odds and have a shot at improving their lives because they are eligible for higher education, we can make sure they get a fair chance of acceptance. That is what Affirmative Action does.",0

"Regarding US shootings check out the suicide rates, gini coefficients, etc. They all follow a similar pattern.

We can blame guns, but they are a perverse tool and it will not end the issue of suicides and homicides in the United States, only put a minor dent in it if somehow the US managed to somehow ban guns. 


DR. PARK DIETZ, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST previously:
&gt; Mass murder is always suicide. And this is a mass murder as well as a suicide. And the principle warnings of this -- not this case, but this phenomenon -- are depression with suicidal thoughts, paranoia, over concern about weapons and power, a history of having conducted surveillance or gathered intelligence about people or stalked people, having a fantasy life that is very much about violence and its utility for making one feel more powerful. And just a handful of other things. 

&gt; **As I began to tell the media often starting around 1993, mass murder is a form of suicide propagated by the mass media.**

"If I'm honest, if I was Trump's criminal defense lawyer, turning the trial into a circus would be exactly my strategy. 

The evidence is extremely solid, at least from my perspective. However, it only takes one juror convinced that the trial is a sham for you to deadlock the jury and get a mistrial. 

Some judges would preclude Trump from mentioning Clinton or Obama or anyone else because they're utterly irrelevant. But I have a feeling that may be ruled admissible and you'll get the trial made into a circus which will increase the odds of a mistrial.",0

"Them being ONLY rich and/or powerful white men has a LOT to do with it. There's nothing wrong with being white, but there's a LOT wrong with all people being governed by the ideas of the most privileged segment of a tiny segment of white people from hundreds of years ago. 

I'm not saying that the founding fathers were necessarily corrupt (although most of them owning people as property while saying all men are equal doesn't look good), I'm saying that there's no way their experience matches that of a modern poor person, woman or racial minority. 

When the Constitution was written, there were only 13 states to make compromises between and they were largely in agreement on the big issues, unlike today. 

Regardless, what part of ""it was a compromise between competing 1700s interests"" do you think makes it MORE current and applicable to the issues of today?",0

"&gt;I got really, really sick  
&gt;  
&gt;We don't even have enough money   
&gt;  
&gt; she wants a divorce

&amp;#x200B;

Not surprising to hear this...   


How long have you been together? Was she with you before you got sick, and was your monetary situation different then? Like did you have more money then?  


I know in these modern ""feminist"" times people like to say that the sexes are equal and that gender roles don't exist anymore... but from what I've seen it seems to me that men are still very much expected to adhere to their traditional gender roles in a marriage. Mainly that means being a protector and a provider. If you were sick and you didn't have money, from the wife's point of view that means you're failing in your role as a husband.  The man is supposed to be a solid rock, the foundation of the relationship... she probably saw you that way before, but after getting sick, suddenly shes' seen you being vulnerable. That's probably why she ""just doesn't feel the same way anymore"".   


This is all speculation on my part of course, I could be way off, but I've seen this happen before. Years ago my dad got sick (cancer, thankfully he eventually beat it, he's doing okay now) and my mom left him. Had a friend go through something similar recently as well.   


&gt;No issues with cheating or anything, there's nobody else, she would've told me.  


Don't assume this, it is possible there is someone else. Heck I might be totally paranoid here, but you may even want to consider doing a paternity test to make sure they kid is actually yours, just to be safe.   


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What can I do?  


  
You can't make her stay, and honestly even if you could, would you even want to? If she suddenly changed her mind and wanted to stay married, would you be able to trust that she won't just bail on you again later?   


So for now, instead of worrying about her, focus on yourself. Do what you can to get healthy. Do what you can to get in a better place financially. Try to find joy in things that don't involve her at all, like maybe you can start a new hobby or something? Go hang out with your friends (preferably YOUR friends, not mutual friends you share with the ex wife).

"It's amazing that he tried to paint this as a bad thing.

And I'm not even looking at the actual moral implications of it. Consent is obviously not a bad thing. I'm talking purely in the tactical sense: what rhetorical tactics are used to control the narrative. From that sense, this is fundamentally flawed. Looking at more recent bad faith arguments from the right to control the narrative, (things like ""Trans people are trying to groom kids""), it's all stupid lies....but at least if it were true, ""grooming kids"" is a legitimate reason to be angered. It's easier to see where the moral outrage comes from.

""We need to protect kids!"" Ok. You're being manipulated here, but the tools of your manipulation are about protection and fear. I at least understand why you would take that side. *On the surface* (and I cannot emphasize enough how surface-level that line of reasoning is), you aren't taking a stance against trans persons, you are taking a stance against grooming children.

"Peoples Republic of California. 

I lived here nearly my whole life. About fifty years. It is only recently that more people are leaving the state than coming in by the hundreds the hundreds of thousands. This is a first in the history of this state. 

Lets call it a Red Flag. 

There are more homeless people living on the streets now than ever before in the major cities. It is my opinion that CA is now the homeless capital of the USA. 

What is odd about this is CA is resident to quite a few billionaires and I would not be surprised if CA had the my billionaires of any other state. 

Tens of thousands of homeless in LA alone. Business are closing as a result and robbery is on the rise.  The new mayor of LA is aware of the situation and there talk of spending hundreds of millions to solve the issue. The state government has never met their budget targets in the past and likely the spending will not stop until it reaches over a billion. 

But it cannot be solved. The vast majority of the homeless dont want to be fixed by the system. They refuse to obey any laws. (Just my opinion but I think most of them are suffering from some mental health issues.) This failure was demonstrated during C19 lockdowns.

So, people in the US tend to think that Mexico is dangerous, and it is. There's drugs, and guns, and gangs, and it's horrific. In general, it's 5 times more likely to be murdered there than in the US.   


But, the US, form the perspective of someone in Germany, *is Mexico*\--it's 5 times more likely to get them murdered. It's 25+ times more likely to get them murdered by gun. From the perspective of someone living in the UK, the US murder by gun rate is 100 times higher in the US, and the overall murder rate is 7 times higher, it's *insane* to think that the US is safe from their perspective.   


But, inside the US, a LOT of that is crime and murder contained to very specific cities, or states--often, small areas inside those cities. I'm sure you're aware of cities like that in India--parts of large cities that are no-go areas for safety, and others that are very very safe.

Our government in Canada would rather give billions to other countries. Then spend a dime on anything in Canada.,0
"In a statement released on Thursday, reacting to reports about the Rucker and Leonnig book, Trump said, I never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our Government. He added, If I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley. Trump said he selected Milley for the post only because he wanted to spite his then Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis, who, he said, could not stand him. I often act counter to peoples advice who I dont respect, Trump noted. The former President posited that Milley, a career military officer, was allowing these accounts to circulate to curry favor with the Radical Left.  
  
Milley had been in full-alarm mode since the summer of 2020. On June 1st, Trump had used the general as a prop in his infamous Lafayette Square photo op: Trump had marched through the plaza minutes after it had been violently cleared of peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters, and following him was Defense Secretary Mark Esper, a pack of his White House advisers, and Milley, who was dressed in combat fatigues, as if at war inside America. Milley, an Irish-Catholic from outside Boston who worships the Constitution and the militarys tradition of political neutrality, considered that photo op his Damascus moment, as he would later call it: a few short minutes of misjudgment that would haunt him forever. He considered resigning but instead decided to do his penance. Ill fight from the inside, he told his staff. The following week, during a previously scheduled commencement address, he apologized publicly for taking part in a political display that was completely inappropriate for the leader of Americas apolitical armed forces.  
  
On June 3rd, in the Pentagon briefing room, Esper announced that he was opposed to invoking the Insurrection Act against protesters and said that he tried to remain apolitical in his job. Soon after Espers statement to the press, Esper, Milley, and the centcom commander, Frank Mackenzie, were scheduled to attend a White House meeting on Afghanistan. Trump, enraged, lit into Esper before Milley could even sit down. The President went apeshit on Esper, Milley told associates, one of the worst such reamings-out he had ever seen. Trump would go on to fire Esper days after he lost the 2020 election. Milley told his aides that he, too, was prepared to be fired, or even court-martialled. In another meeting after Milleys speech, Trump, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, demanded to know why Milley had apologized; apologies, Trump told him, according to an account that Milley later repeated, are a sign of weakness. Not where I come from, Milley replied, as he later told associates. Milley said he had to ask for forgiveness because he was a soldier in uniform who did not belong at a political event. I dont expect you to understand, Milley had said. Its an ethic for us, a duty. (In his statement on Thursday, Trump referenced his anger at Milleys apology. I saw at that moment he had no courage or skill, certainly not the type of person I would be talking coup with. Im not into coups!)  
  
A running concern for Milley was the prospect of Trump pushing the nation into a military conflict with Iran. He saw this as a real threat, in part because of a meeting with the President in the early months of 2020, at which one of Trumps advisers raised the prospect of taking military action to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons if Trump were to lose the election. At another meeting, at which Trump was not present, some of the Presidents foreign-policy advisers again pushed military action against Iran. Milley later said that, when he asked why they were so intent on attacking Iran, Vice-President Mike Pence replied, Because they are evil.  
  
In the months after the election, with Trump seemingly willing to do anything to stay in power, the subject of Iran was repeatedly raised in White House meetings with the President, and Milley repeatedly argued against a strike. Trump did not want a war, the chairman believed, but he kept pushing for a missile strike in response to various provocations against U.S. interests in the region. Milley, by statute the senior military adviser to the President, was worried that Trump might set in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified. Trump had a circle of Iran hawks around him and was close with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was also urging the Administration to act against Iran after it was clear that Trump had lost the election. If you do this, youre gonna have a fucking war, Milley would say.  
  
Finally, on January 3rd, after Trump had flown back from his Christmas vacation at Mar-a-Lago, he convened the Oval Office meeting on Iran, asking his advisers about recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency on Irans nuclear activities. Both Mike Pompeo and the national-security adviser, Robert OBrien, told Trump that it was not possible to do anything militarily at that point. Their attitude was that it was too late to hit them. After Milley walked through the potential costs and consequences, Trump agreed. And that was that: after months of anxiety and uncertainty, the Iran fight was over.  
  
At the very end of the meeting Trump brought up the forthcoming rally of his supporters on January 6th, asking Milley and the acting Defense Secretary, Christopher Miller, if they were prepared for what Trump had already promised, on Twitter, would be a wild protest. It was a short conversation, Milley later recalled to associates, no more than a couple of minutes at the end of an hour-long meeting. Its gonna be a big deal, Milley heard Trump say. Youre ready for that, right? It was the last time the President would ever speak to his Joint Chiefs chairman.  
  
Just three days later, on January 6th, a version of Milleys nightmare scenario played out anyway: an attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob seeking to stop Congress from ratifying Bidens victory. Milley had not envisioned it, not exactlyhis fears had been largely about street violence, involving running battles between pro-Trump thugs and left-wing opponents that Trump might use as a pretext for demanding martial law. This was the analogy to Germany in the nineteen-thirties that Milley had in mind. When January 6th happened, it wasnt quite like that, of course. But Milley told others on that awful day that what they had dreaded had come to pass: Trump had his Reichstag moment after all.",0

With that being said anyone who flies a PKK flag is a Terrorist supporter in my eyes. To me a PKK flag is as bad as running an ISIS or Taliban flag. That to me is the core issue with Swedens predicament. PKK is recognized as a Terrorist entity by NATO. How do you think the average Turk feels when they see these events in a country that wants to be our allies? All Sweden is doing is buttering Erdogans toast by allowing this and not extraditing terrorists. He comes out on TV and just goes Eyyyyyyy Sweden, rambles on and the average people just eat it up. You want to stop all this BS then stop enabling terrorists. This includes Turkey as well. We all know damn they bought ISIS oil and allowed ISIS to transport their wounded.

"Indeed. They tried on behalf of some people who were close to paying off their loans and would incur some kind of tax penalty through the forgiveness (something like that, I forget the specifics).  But then the Biden administration offered an opt out of the relief, so the opponents had to go find another injured party (actually injured, willing, or not).

I might argue that Mohela has benefitted greatly from this because lots of people had to consolidate and switch to their service to get the potential benefits of the relief. And lots of people will still have lingering studentoan debt if the relief goes through, so Mohela will still be getting payments and fees",0

"Not necessarily high current, it could be very high voltage instead. 

The electrical grid uses really high voltage so it doesn't have to have enormous power lines (plus some other benefits). It then gets stepped down.

The tradeoff is that you're putting more equipment on the car side, since it has to step down the voltage.

As for the battery, if I had to guess, they're doing charging at a per cell or per cell group level. It's more efficient (time wise) that way, just requires more energy versus the charge all through the same circuit method.",0

I can understand your feeling of disgust and as someone who has been SA'd and around both men and women who have also been SA'd i can tell you this view, in my experience is toxic.

Sugar Intake (Intake numbers per capita don't exist but these are production numbers which usually translate to demand)

Have you asked her why she wants to move out of student accommodation? Maybe her reasons are valid?

Next ask has she gone through the rental/house share agreement? Has she spoken to this guy about how the house share will work, not only financially,  but shared expenses, food, utilities,  etc. House rules - can friends stay over, parties, etc.
Also ask her her exit strategy if things go wrong. Be gentle. Point out it's this guys house and what if he and her friend break up, because they are in a relatively new relationship? He might not want her friend and your gf to stay in the house.  Or her friend might not want to stay if it goes sour. So put it more like the guy could be an issue and break up, not that her friend is not a big relationship person.

Do it more as a supportive thing - as you know she's excited, and you want to make sure she'll be ok. I would be careful about saying or implying it's a bad decision,  but more of a ""let's look at the whole picture just in case it goes wrong"" type conversation.

&gt; BRASILIA, June 27 - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was staring into the political abyss on Tuesday when a federal electoral court justice voted to bar him from office until 2030 for anti-democratic abuse of power during last year&amp;#039;s fraught election.

&gt; Bolsonaro stands accused of abusing his power when he summoned ambassadors last year and vented unfounded claims about the security of Brazil&amp;#039;s electronic voting system, one of a series of attacks that critics say were aimed at diminishing voters&amp;#039; faith in the vote.

&gt; Bolsonaro had appeared increasingly sanguine about his hopes of political survival in the lead-up to the vote.

right now we're going through a massive uptick of transphobia and the trans community being in the public eye much more than we typically have been. those of us within the community have seen the target on our backs for a while, and known that we would be the next culture war issue while people circled around us trying to find an angle. they tried a few things! school bathrooms got a few bites several years ago but largely fizzled out. healthcare didn't work because everyone got distracted by how bad our healthcare system is in general in the usa. youth sports had some false starts and then really started catching on. for a while it was ""ROGD"" and ""the transgender craze stealing our daughters""that one is still popular, and dangerous, and targets young trans men specifically. unfortunately it's just a lot easier to get one of these hate campaigns to take off when your target is easily identified and doesn't require any real understanding of anything to target, which is why trans women receive the brunt of it so often. to the outsider, who doesn't understand trans issues and doesn't want to, they don't have to worry about learning 200 different things and getting deep into the transphobic brain worms of the hardcore transphobes. all they've gotta do is have a hazy idea of a ""man in a dress"" who is unfamiliar and unattractive to them, easily identified, and can therefore be feared and hated. rinse, repeat.",0

"The US absolutely could. Mexico+South America, India, Canada, Europe, the US can trade with anyone. In a war scenario, China can only trade with whomever they have the infrastructure overland to in a war scenario, and in the current hightening cold war the US is already beginning to massively shift away from China, and cut off the flow of high tech parts that have been critical to all modern Chinese advances.(Their homegrown electronics are still a solid 10-20 years behind).

In terms of China being an economic threat in the consumer market on market(ignoring Belt and Road stuff)China's PPP-adjusted GDPPC is shy of $19,000. Thats worse than the Dominican Republic and just better than Thailand. Unadjusted USD, it's $12,000 and change, which is worse than Panama.

"&gt;  if somehow the US managed to somehow ban guns. 

For the record, I am all for stronger gun regulation but **banning** guns in the United States will never happen, nor should it.

I understand our friends in Europe may not understand why, but this is a very complex issue and ""banning guns"" will do not have the desired affect when we have so many unregistered firearms floating around the country and virtually no way of enforcing gun regulation as serious as a ""gun ban"".  All you would do is aggravate the issue and make law-abiding citizens that do submit to such legislation, more vulnerable. In parts of the country where fast access to police is not viable, you are expected to protect yourself and your family. And for many, that means firearms.

As someone on the left, I really wish Democrats would drop the narrative of ""taking away your guns"".  Not only will it never happen because its practically impossible, its tone deaf to parts of this country that rely on firearms for personal safety because there is literally no better option.

With that said, I am all for more gun regulation. There are enough violent incidents where people *did* go through the proper procedures in getting a firearm and I think regulation can absolutely minimize the incidents where people who shouldn't have a gun, cant get one AND/OR better training to mitigate incidents that involve a firearm. 

In my opinion, people don't need to have automatic assault rifles(EDIT: or bump stocks on their semi-automatic rifles that effectively makes them full automatic rifles). There should be better background checks and training. It should not be easier to get a firearm than a drivers license. But the ""We're going to ban guns"" narrative needs to stop because its literally impossible to execute on and its a narrative that scares people and unfortunately makes people think Democrats don't live in reality.",0

It's the same with police or authority wether that be HR, Schools etc... If there's an incident between a man and a women they'll instantly take the womens side without sufficient evidence or they'll ignore it entirely.

Their whole solution is to use the law to define something as wrong so they can behind authority and say ""well ,it's the law"" because there is no logic or good intentions for how the proposed laws can be applied.

"I lived this for over 20 years. I was always the problem and sought psychiatric help and therapy. Years on antipaychotic medication when all I needed was away from her and more therapy. 

Check my post history if you like but the short story is she made us all think she tried to kill herself to force a divorce, begged forgiveness a year after I left, treats my Daughters badly, eldest just moved and is so relieved. My youngest is moving in with me for college next year.

Turns out ex is borderline or bipolar with severe mood swings (why didn't I tell her????), won't take her mood stabilisers because she got ""better"". She would even let my eldest take her own bed I paid for and didn't lift a finger to help her move. She is selfish, self centered and has to have drama to function.

It took me 2 years to heal, had to give up a management job because of the unbearable stress of believing I was the reason she wanted to die and she still breaks me at times when I see how she hurts my girls.

If yours won't stick to treatment and therapy it will be a long and very difficult road for you.

&gt;Before everyone gets too spun up about reports Judge Cannon has been assigned to the Trump case, a little law. I used to be an appellate chief in the 11th Circuit (where Florida is) and I litigated a few appeals where we asked the court of appeals to order a judge to recuse.  
&gt;  
&gt;Altho a judge's behavior in court generally doesn't form the basis for recusal, the 11th Circuit has ordered ""reassignment"" where a judge leans so heavily for a defendant they call their objectivity in the eyes of the public into question. (US v. Martin)  
&gt;  
&gt;This is persuasive authority that Judge Cannon must step aside if the case falls to her as a permanent assignment. Her court &amp; certainly the 11th won't tolerate the damage it would do to their credibility if she failed to voluntarily recuse.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is not clear Cannon is permanently assigned to the case. If she is, it's extremely unlikely it stays with her and as a last resort, DOJ will challenge her participation and win.

In most applications the final driven component, be it a pump, a ship's propeller shaft, the road wheels of a car, etc, etc, is not running at the engine's crankshaft speed - there's a crafty device called a gearbox which raises or lowers shaft speed as necessary &amp; magically increases or decreases torque at the output shaft by the same ratio!",0

At the end of the day, China is a totalitarian dictatorship and commits human rights violation, and the rest of the world should think of moving production out of China, and maybe one of the positives of that would also be reduction in the use of non-renewable energy sources.

"&gt;she doesn't have the power to dismiss the case

Yes she does. As already explained, not only would she have this power, but it would not even be appealable.

&gt;and you think she's safe if she did?

Yes, you naive rube. Nothing would happen to her if she exercised her power as a judge.

&gt;You think Feds wouldn't be at her house the next week with a warrant?

A warrant for what? Issuing a clearly biased ruling is not probable cause for any kind of crime. If the ruling isn't appealable, then *by definition* it wouldn't be possible for it to be de facto evidence of any wrongdoing.

&gt;IF she sneezes wrong, she's going to be in prison faster than she can lower the gavel.

Sneezing wrong isn't a crime. You really don't seem to know what you're talking about.

Now, the upside in all this is that if she makes biased rulings in the case, the DoJ can and will ask the 11th Circuit to reverse her decisions or force her to recuse. So in a practical sense, it's very likely that she'll either recuse or be forced to recuse before all this is done.

*But*, that's exactly why the Rule 29 motion is so dangerous. If she manages to handle the entire trial with complete fairness, no hint of bias, no reason to force her to recuse, and *then* grants the Rule 29 motion, *there's nothing anyone could do about it*. So the most cunning, crafty Trump ally would do that. We kind of just have to hope that Cannon isn't smart enough to do it that way. To be fair, based on her previous rulings on the search warrant, she's almost certainly not that smart. But the fact remains, if she's still presiding over this case by the time the trial concludes, *you should be very worried*.",0

"In my experience, the people who want to make religion special are equally zealous, tbh. 

To defend the idea that religion is special, we have to find some neurobiological evidence for that; we have to explain why one class of idea is uniquely more powerful than another.

Because of the scope and scale of religious ideologies we're persuaded that the scope and scale of the power obtaining therefrom must be equally potent. But we don't evaluate that fairly, because religious narratives are embedded in social power structures. We lay at the feet of religion things like family, class, authority, law, and a litany of other things that, for historical reasons, are entwined with religion but are, rightfully, also independent edifices contributing their own influence and power. 

Faith is toothless without sociocultural structural support, and that sprawling base isn't, itself, composed of religion. We like to say that religion causes wars, but we don't ask whence the militaries themselves that are ostensibly weilded by it. When you break it all down, religion is just a mask painted onto a great big machine, and that machine does almost all the work.",0

This isn't a normal or a healthy partnership. Listen... I think you already know this, but it's all just a game to her for attention and power. Manipulating you into feeling bad (i.e. no-win situations) so that you are ALWAYS, PERPETUALLY trying to make it up to her. She's arranged the balance so that she is always upset with you and you are always struggling to please her. Of course this probably works pretty well for her. She gets your attention, she has the power to make you run around at the drop of a hat to satisfy her whims.. but how can YOU live like that? I would seriously consider an ultimatum - she goes to therapy to try and work on this with you, or you need to end things. You are NOT crazy. It IS off. It is toxic and not healthy. If she refuses to go, I would just end things. Someone not willing to work on things to make you happier and your relationship healthier, is not a partner you need to be with.

"&gt; judges decide challenges to elections rules, allow or refuse gerrymandering claims etc;

That isnt the same as overriding the electorate. Thats ensuring a fair election. In fact its the exact opposite - they are expected to uphold and ensure that every person is able to make their vote count. The idea is that no leader chosen by the people could be prevented from taking office by the courts as a political prisoner. 

&gt; judges determine eligibility for holding high office.

No they do not, in the case of the federal government. No felony conviction may disqualify a person from holding position at a senator, congressman, or president/vice president. 

&gt; There will always be some line drawing about who can and cannot run for office. 

Not in the USA, other than citizenship. Age in the case of President but thats it. 

&gt; instead, an independent judiciary appears to be applying s politically neutral (and not otherwise discriminatory) law that quite reasonably says that people convicted of certain crimes shouldnt wield executive power

If the judiciary were truly neutral, independent and incorruptible, then we wouldnt need democracy. We could just have an elite group of judges who picks all of our leaders for us. And then those leaders would pick those judges. And as long as there were never any *bad people* in those positions, wed live in a perfect utopia!

&except that no one, no institution is incorruptible. Thats why we dont leave those decisions up to judges, we leave them up to the people. If a leader does something bad, let the people be the judge of that. If someone is unfit for office, then the voters should not vote for them. Supreme power rests with the people above all else. 

&gt; theres nothing terribly anti democratic about it in this application.


China makes the same claim about Hong Kong. They claim that the electoral process was chosen by the people and that people are free to vote for whomever they wish - provided of course that its not someone that the Party deems unacceptable. They go through all the motions of democracy but then they exercise a power that is higher than the electorate to disqualify everyone who isnt a pre-approved party candidate.

&gt;The job of the Courts is not to interpret what Congress thinks or intends, it actually doesn't even matter what Congress thinks. The Court is supposed to look at the law and goes ""does this interfere with the Constitution."" 

Are you sure about that? The Supreme Court is explicitly tasked with interpreting of the law passed by Congress. Though not explicitly spelled out, the case is about President making up powers that weren't explicitly spelled out in the laws and this case is about making up those powers. If Supreme Court didn't find that the Congress meant for the law to grant the power, then it can reverse the President's decision.",0

"Im a professional land use planner in Toronto, so I guess its a bit more of an objective take when I say that the amalgamation of Metro Toronto has been incredibly beneficial to the city, but yeah, at the time and even still now, a lot of people have not been a big fan. A lot of people view the incorporation of the inner-ring suburbs as bad because the people living in Etobicoke, North York, and Scarborough have historically been more conservative leaning, pro-car oriented development, and pro-low density development than those living in the core. On the other hand, if the city was not amalgamated, the infrastructure would be a lot worse, the city would not be as cohesive and well connected, and the only people who would reap the benefits are those who are rich enough to live downtown. But as a result, we tend to have some NIMBY councillors from more suburban areas of the city who block development and resist intensification. 

Regarding the Province thing, section 92 of the Canadian Constitution Act breaks up the exclusive powers of provincial government and says that municipalities are Creatures of the Statute. Which essentially means that Provincial governments have more or less complete power over municipal governments, which is very different to the Home Rule that American cities have. So when the Province makes decisions to amalgamate or dissolve municipalities or change the size of council or anything like that, a lot of people view it as government overreach, even though its well within their authority, and all of the municipalities involved would essentially have to agree before any of these huge decisions are made.",0

I'm not entirely sure what the first point refers to (not a lawyer) because I would assume filing the witness list is a normal part of any trial (would love for someone to weight in on that part specifically). The rest of her points, it seems like the list could be filed that satisfies both parties and what reason would she use to turn it down at that point?

"Im going to be 100% honest with you, and it might be a difficult thing to hear. Most things dealing with our own personal development usually are, because they start with acknowledgement and acceptance. Theres ofc far more to this than i could ever write on a Reddit response. Essentially your (both of you) problem isnt the problem. Your (both of you) problem is what caused the problem. Based on what youve written, and this goes for both of you, I see a lot of passive aggressive statements, you focused statements, avoidance, defensiveness, invalidation etc.. 

(I am curious to know how old you two are)
First thing first. Discussing/resolving/communicating important emotional issues through text does not typically give the proper mental space or emotional bandwidth to fully explore each others feelings. 

There seems to be a lot going on more than just this one  event. The tricky thing is that you BOTH need to learn together. It doesnt work if only one person does it.

There is a fuckton more to all this but for now my best advice would be for BOTH of you to talk in person. Know your limit. Be familiar with your own glass of emotional water. When it gets full& you need to take a brake.. a couple hrs, a nights sleep etc., because once that glass starts overflowing, its gonna make a mess. Things will be said that cant be unsaid, and there will be more emotional pain than there needs to be. The following points apply to both of you:

1. Listen. Do not try to win the conversation. Your first goal is to listen to your partner. Dont just sit there and hear what they have to say& actually listen. This is difficult, because for you to be a good listener, your partner needs to be a good talker. It goes both ways. Like throwing a ball and catching it. If you partner throws it well, you can catch it well. If your partner is a bit off.. sometimes youll need to compensate, and vice Versa. 

2. Validate their feelings. You may disagree with their point of view, but you cannot disagree with their feelings. Even if they are dead wrong, feeling hurt is still feeling hurt. Validating your partners feelings is the most important thing you can do. It is immensely difficult because it often requires you to set aside your pride, ego and general sense of but i didnt do anything wrong. Say things like.. yeah.. i didnt do the dishes (even if it was because legitimately forgot, or because you had to take the dog to the vet).. i didnt do the dishes and it makes sense that youre upset about it, because i said that i would. Your partner can be both compassionate and upset at the same time. 

3. Defensiveness. Dont. Get. Defensive. You will find yourself trying to explain away why theyre misunderstanding the situation, or why they dont see it your way, or if they could just understand this one tiny bit then they would totally understand where Im coming from. Thats a no no. That breaks point number 2. It utterly invalidates their feelings. 

4. Accept your shortcomings, flaws, room for improvement. Face it.. 9 billion out of 9 billion people are imperfect. Our lives are a series of mistakes, which we hopefully learn from as we get older. You are no different, and neither is your partner. Have the capacity to say,  shit.. i fucked that one up.. let me put it in a mental (or physical) note so that then i fuck it up again, it wont be fucked up quite as bad. Its very freeing to allow yourself the room to make mistakes. Acknowledge them. Accept them. Work on bettering yourself. 

5. What do you need from me? Weve been through talking about thins thing over and over, hopefully not in circles, but most likely in circles. So. 

You: tell me specifically, what you you need from me? 

Partner: I need you to say.. yes i forgot the dishes. I understand that a tidy sink is important to you because its one of the things that brings peace to your day.

You: I understand how you feel. There are many other areas of chaos in your life, and i get why this is important to you. A tidy sink in our house sounds great. Ill work on keeping up my end of the dish duty. 

Partner: Is there anything you need from me?

You: It hurts me when there are long gaps in our texts.. especially for important things. It gives me anxiety and a general sense of uncertainty. Can we figure out a better way to talk.. or not talk (if we need some time to settle down)?

Partner: Thank you for saying how you were feeling, rather than saying what I did to make you feel that way. I like that you approached it from your internal perspective and what you were feeling, instead of saying you statement. I think some cool off time is important when our glasses are about to overflow. I have an idea. Lets share some ice cream and try to explore our feelings about the situation in a healthier way for the relationship.",0

"Some relevant details for the discussion:

- Sweden has agreed to extradite to Turkey a man convicted of drug trafficking who also supported the pro-Kurdish PKK. 

- The decision comes after the Supreme Court in May cleared his repatriation to Turkey, where he is expected to serve out a drug trafficking sentence.

- The man, whose extradition was cleared, was sentenced in 2014 to four years and seven months in a Turkish prison for transporting a bag containing cannabis, according to the Swedish Supreme Court ruling. He was released on parole and moved to Sweden but was arrested in August last year following a request from Turkish prosecutors.

"Its possible hes just very shy and innocent. I used to be this way, and my partner had way more experience with sex and kink in particular. One thing that helped me is her guidance. 

If its unfamiliar to him, its awkward for him to do. When youre in the act, ask him playfully/seductively what you want. If you want to try positions other than missionary, maybe get on all fours before you all start and wiggle your butt at him. If you want him to pull your hair, tell him!

If hes silent when youre giving him head, ask him if he likes it. You like this (pet name)? 

It might take some coaxing, but if you try to do it like this while in the act it might have a better result for you. Just telling someone what you like doesnt always work, especially if its something hes not used to. Show him!

"when I (50M) was growing yp I remember seeing my dad drink alot, but I really only remember seeing him trashed/wasted like 2 times.

I became a single father to my 2 boys. I started having a beer or 2 after they went to bed, didn't want them seeing me drink.. then it turned into 6 after bed.  then 1 before they went to bed and 8 plus after
.  I always tried to protect them from seeing me like that but I know they knew, I was ashamed etc.   

My oldest is going to be 25 and he doesn't drink, but he does smoke  weed, and has for awhile, my youngest will be 24 end of the year and he rarely drinks. I've talked to them both about how, at that time I was super stressed and unhappy with my life etc, and used drinking to escape.  I think me being open and honest with them helped them realize, that drinking etc, doesn't help you really escape anything.  

I'm 50, married to a great wife and we have a great house and I'm the happiest I've ever been,  I still have some beers here and there, sometimes drink to many hanging with friends, but it's not me trying to escape anything.  I imagine some folks would say I drink to much, maybe, but I don't drink every day,  I don't HAVE to drink at all

Divorce is ugly, especially with children involved, and no one wants to go through it if they can avoid it. In the latter case, it's more likely that they haven't begun to take relationships seriously yet and suffer from FOMO. In both cases there may be financial dependency, fear of losing face in the community, or the twisted thrill some people get from doing something awful in secret and trying not to get caught.

I would never put it that way (train like a puppy) , but in general, praising people for when they do something you like is a pretty normal thing and comes in handy when raising children as well. . 

 If you felt that you really were manipulated against your will and you do not actually like your current style, then say that. But if it is just the fact that he thought this all through and chose to praise you for a particular style he liked, I wouldn't worry about it.

You could have married someone who nagged or yelled at you , instead you got someone who loves how you look and especially praises you in certain styles. If that bothers you, decide what you want to wear that you are not wearing and wear it anyway.

&gt; Breaking News: Olivia Chow Emerges Victorious as Mayor-Elect, Bringing Fresh Vision to Toronto
&gt; 
&gt; June 27, 2023
&gt; 
&gt; Toronto, ON - In an exciting turn of events, Olivia Chow has been declared the mayor-elect of Toronto, marking a historic moment for the city. The announcement comes after a closely contested mayoral race that captivated residents and saw Chow emerge as the choice to lead the city into a new era.
&gt; 
&gt; With her extensive political background and a deep-rooted commitment to public service, Chow's victory represents a significant shift in Toronto's political landscape. Known for her progressive ideals and tireless advocacy for social causes, she has long been a champion for the people of Toronto.
&gt; 
&gt; Chow's campaign was built on a foundation of inclusivity, community engagement, and a vision of a more equitable city for all residents. Throughout her campaign, she emphasized the importance of affordable housing, sustainable development, and improved public transportation, striking a chord with citizens who were eager for change.
&gt; 
&gt; As the first woman of Asian descent to hold the mayoral office in Toronto, Chow's win not only shatters glass ceilings but also highlights the city's embrace of diversity and representation. Her victory sends a powerful message of empowerment to underrepresented communities and demonstrates the city's commitment to inclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; In her victory speech, Olivia Chow expressed gratitude to the people of Toronto for their support and pledged to work tirelessly to address the pressing issues facing the city. She stressed the need for collaborative decision-making, promising to listen to the voices of all Torontonians and ensure that their concerns are heard.
&gt; 
&gt; Chow's extensive political experience, including her previous tenure as a Member of Parliament, positions her well to navigate the complexities of city governance. Her track record as a dedicated public servant and her ability to build coalitions across party lines will likely prove invaluable as she seeks to implement her progressive agenda.
&gt; 
&gt; The challenges that lie ahead for Mayor-Elect Chow are vast, but so too are the opportunities to shape Toronto's future. With her bold vision and a commitment to social justice, Chow has the potential to steer the city towards sustainable development, improved public services, and a more inclusive society.
&gt; 
&gt; As Toronto bids farewell to its previous administration, all eyes turn to Olivia Chow as she prepares to take the helm as the city's mayor. The hopes and aspirations of a diverse and vibrant population now rest on her capable shoulders. The city eagerly awaits the transformative leadership that Chow promises to deliver.
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations, Mayor-Elect Olivia Chow! Toronto is ready to embark on a new chapter under your guidance, and its residents stand united in anticipation of the positive changes that lie ahead.",0

"It's cattle panel arched between T-posts from Tractor Supply.  I also used one on it's side as you can [kinda see here.](https://i.imgur.com/1WnXAhi.jpeg) The middle panels are a ball cage from Family Dollar I cut up into individual panels and supported with T-posts.

The arched cattle panels are really great for pole/runner beans but work really well for indeterminate heirloom tomatoes. I use additional T-posts in between the arches with cheap thick gauge wire I picked up at Ace that I run down the length of the trellises going down in height at about foot intervals. That's where my determinates go cause they still need staking of course.

It can be a little bit of an investment at first but I've used the same material for years, even the wire.

I've been meaning to make a quick walk around video for my mom in Florida anyway, I'll shoot you a DM so you can see it in better detail.

I am 110% certain the Florida case is the DOJs least-disturbing case, which is why they brought it first.   I would bet anything they are offering him a sweetheart plea deal; probably an admission of guilt with 6-9 months home confinement delayed until after the election.  In exchange they will drop all their other investigations.  Including this Iran thing.   Including Jan 6.  Including the wire fraud.   Everything at the federal level.   Just admit guilt in this one little Boxes Hoax case.   

They do not want to destroy a former POTUS.  But Trump is too proud to plead guilty.  So they will destroy him.   And they end up seizing a lot of assets for fines and putting him away for the rest of his life.   If he sold anything he took it might be even worse.",0

It seems less like the judge would have issue with a law preventing children from seeing things considered too adult and more like the wording is a vague, abstract giant can of worms for the legal system, were it to pass.

"Hugely reductive thinking. We do not, and have arguably never, lived in a free and open market. Our reliance on fossil fuels is not just the best product winning or something, the world we live in has been designed from the start in order to maximise profits for a very small number of people and to the detriment, probably, of billions. 

The U.S. used to have a thriving public transport system with plans to expand and increase existing infrastructure. This would have been good environmentally. However, the head guys at Chevy and Ford lobbied heavily for this money to be poured into roads and highways instead and car infrastructure became the standard. 

In the UK (and probably everywhere else), oil companies donate heavily to political parties, which opens the door for the minimisation of green policies, such as switching from fossil fuels, the opening of new oil wells, etc. 

Progress is being made but it's at an agonisingly slow pace considering the scale of the problem we're confronting, and this slowness is because we have to fight back against fossil fuel lobbying at every step.

"I wasnt the one who insisted that all decisions on war must go through politicians, so Im not sure what youre complaining about here.

Strategic ambiguity is commonly seen as the best solution for situations like this - convey very clearly through back channels what the response will be, without publicly declaring and pre-committing to exact reactions (which in turn has the additional danger that if Putin perceives any such commitments as not entirely credible, i.e. if he assumes they could be a bluff, he has a strong incentive to attempt to call the bluff, and then NATO has only the option of either instigating nuclear war or losing all credibility).

In light of this, my argument is that the strategic ambiguity we currently have (make it clear via back channels what the response will be, but not make it public so theres no incentive for an attempt to publicly call a bluff) is most likely by far the best strategy, and hence trying to kill this via an explicit law that removes all strategic ambiguity is a very bad idea.",0

Nobody ""knows"" they are intelligent. To say as much is to admit you're under the Dunning Kruger effect. People who are actually recognized as smart often don't say shit like ""wow I'm so smart!""

If you actually practiced what you preached (being open-minded), you would also be open to the possibility that astrology is a load of bull and has no scientific evidence to back it up. But you seem firmly closed on that front.

The moon's gravity applies a minor gravitational pull to you as it goes over you. That's it. At most this displaces some fluids in your body a few nanometers. Walking up and down the stairs would shift gravity's effect on you about the same.

Does this affect personality? I mean... maybe? If you believe in a deterministic universe, then every single force that interacts with your atoms does influence *something,* in some way, yes. Is it enough to cause radical personality differences or affect ""luck"" in any way? No, absolutely not.

If astrology ever actually does something, it's almost certainly a placebo effect. Placebos are very real, but that's all they are - lies that people believe to feel better.",0

"Yeah, as the wife of someone who's parent would write a post like this, I'm going to ask:

**What are this missing reasons?**

Because when my husband and I went to our last Christmas with his family, **they complained.** Their complaint sounded like this: **You're our son, and you live interstate, and you only gave us** ***three*** **days! You spent most of the time in your bedroom! How dare you? How dare you treat us like this? We made heaps of food, organised everything, had a lovely Christmas, and you ignored us and treated us like shit and only spent three days with us! What did we do to make you hate us so much?** 

**The real story:**

I fell down a flight of stairs and put my head through a wall and broke my back. My husband's parents messaged and harassed my parents every fucking day of that year to ask why I was so deformed and broken and messed up that they didn't have grandkids yet - and I do mean **everyday.** For Christmas, we were trying so hard to mend the relationship, because at that point, his parents were a) harassing my family non-stop, b) harassing and abusing me daily, c) pretending everything we had tried to discuss was a lie, and d) tried to get my husband to repeatedly divorce me by saying I was lying about my broken back. We **told them we could come up for Christmas, and that because my husband had just changed jobs, he had no more than five days leave. We could bring our dog, Rosie, and spend five days there, or we could make arrangements for our dog, and only spend three days there. His parents insisted that our dog couldn't come, and that was fine. We said there was no problem with that, but as a result of making those arrangements, the costs, everything, that we could only be there for three days. We'd fly in, have Christmas, fly out.** 

They then **made sure that there was almost nothing I could eat. I have severe allergies, which they were aware of, and his dad informed me of this as he covered one of the few foods I could eat in alcohol, staring me dead in the eyes saying, ""I'm not going out again for you. If you have nothing to eat here, then that's on you.""** (This man would also later have a tantrum when I ate his olives.) On top of that, **the only Christmas presents they got for me were presents for their son. For example, this mother, as she passed me a gift, said, ""I know you don't like science fiction, but this is such a pretty book, and I figure, \[son's name\] will** ***love*** **it."" And that happened with** ***every*** **gift (****~~I~~** **husband got three).** On top of that, **whenever I got a gift from anyone else (husband), his father would STORM OUT OF THE ROOM AND THROW A TANTRUM AND HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE TO CALM HIM DOWN AS HE SHOUTED ABOUT HOW ""SELFISH"" I WAS.** They then made *repeated comments* that it was **perfectly okay if my husband came, but left me behind, and that they wished he had.** I then needed **repeated lie-downs because that's kinda what happens when you fall down the stairs and throw your head through a wall and break your spine.** The rehab and recovery was *difficult.*

In short, my husband's parents: **Abused me and my family for an entire year, made our journey as difficult as possible. They abused me for getting presents, and every present they gave me was for my partner. They made me starve for three days, and did everything they could - including throwing a tantrum over me eating olives - to prevent me from eating.** 

Sure, you could say they ""fed"" me and ""gave me gifts"", but all they did was **abuse and torture my partner and me.** 

Now, do I believe that there's every possibility that you're telling the truth? Sure. Some people are just twats.

But I ask you: **Are you sure there's no missing reasons?**

Because **my husband's parents have missing reasons for the daughter they disowned a few years after this event, too. They would say their daughter was rude and ruined Christmas, but would not say they disowned their daughter on Christmas night 2020 in the middle of the pandemic in a state she hadn't lived in for a decade because she asked her parents not to use the ""n"" while they advocated for mass-genocide of Blak people.**

I also know that anyone who is truly separated from a loved one thinks over every little mistake they might have made, asking if it's that and how to fix it, whereas those with missing reasons? 

**They tend to list everything good they've ever done and ask ""How did this happen to me?""**",0

In general I agree that it doesnt make sense to hang onto a relationship that has an end date. However I will add one caveat. If she is only going to be around for a short while (eg a few weeks to a month) it might be worth it to enjoy the last bit of time with each other. Obviously it depends on your emotional ability to actually positively exist in that type of relationship. If you are able to think of it more as a sweet send off into the future than it could be nice. Kind of like cherishing the last few days before a loved one passes on. However I would only do this if its a very short time period and you are confident in your ability to understand that it will in fact end when she leaves. If it is a long term departure I would not wait and if you have reservations about your ability to let go I would also rip the band aid off but if not try and enjoy the little time you have left. Regardless of what you choose best of luck!,0

In fact, the Soviets were at first quite concerned about Hitler's actions.

It is not morally justifiable to engage in war for conquest and ethnic nationalism.  It is morally justifiable to engage in war to defend yourself.

I think I've made it clear that it is not OK with me for people to fail to spay/neuter, it is not OK with me for people to ever acquire pets if they are not completely able to provide for them in every way despite a move or financial challenge, it is not OK to let your dog roam even if they are fixed, it is not OK to purposefully breed dogs unless you are very well qualified and are able to raise any unsold offspring for life. It is also not OK to fight dogs and if we got that through people's heads we would have a lot fewer unwanted pitties. 

I want every dog to have a good life. That means if you have a dog you care for it forever and you never make unwanted dogs. It doesn't mean that I have some obligation to fix that after unethical thoughtless people do awful things.",0

I don't know that their neighbours have actually signed a defence pact with them. There is the EU defensive treaty, but no one is that sure of how strong that is. The US didn't want to make a formal bilateral defence agreement with Sweden, so that's also sort of a lie. That said, the UK did sign a bilateral treaty iirc committing it to the defence of Sweden (and Finland) during the application process and placing them under the British nuclear umbrella.",0

"Theres a long history of people using science as a backdrop to hang incorrect/morally awful ideas from. It was used in the 19th century to classify various ethnic groups as more/less evolved, and therefore more/less deserving to be enslaved, occupied, or otherwise mistreated as human beings (see scientific racism). It was used after Darwins theories of evolution were published to claim that society worked in the same way, and that poor people were therefore less capable of survive in society than rich people (social Darwinism). It was used by alt medical groups to claim that the secret to curing all diseases was to give you the same disease, provided you add enough water and shake it up real good homeopathy).

The general thread we see in cases like this is that the people creating these theories knew what they wanted the results to be, and they used science they had access to to justify those conclusions. But real science works the opposite way: you dont  form a conclusion until you see all of the results. Pseudo scientists often are found to have cherry-picked their references, removing studies that actually contradicted their findings. But thats not important to them, because the point always was that they can say what they wanted to say, with a second voice that sounds like it supports them.

Which brings us back to the alpha theory. The toxic-masculinity community latched into this idea because it suited their own theories about masculinity: that some men are naturally stronger and more dominant than other men, and those men should get a higher social status than their peers. The fact that the theory was later discredited, by the man who wrote the original theory no less, was irrelevant to that community. They needed a supporting voice, and theyll take it from anywhere.",0

"Consumers absolutely do benefit from automation of production, it means more and consistent supply. Automation is just the latest in productive technology. What do you think the price of food would be if it was all done by hand? In the literal sense. No machines, and no draft animals either. How much food gets produced?

How many houses could we build if people had to process lumber by hand? We already have a shortage of housing, but the reason housing was ever affordable was because of the industrialized production of building materials.

All firms are profit maximizing, but capital intensive firms can reap better margins while competing on price against labor intensive firms in the same market.

The issue is that laborers are consumers just at a different time of day, and the ownership structure of private property means productivity gains from accrue to owners of capital, not the laborers whose productivity has improved with technology. A capitalist then argues that this is a good thing because the profit for a capital owner is the incentive to invest further.",0

Before Wikipedia, print encyclopedias were also criticized for not being reliable. Some teachers didn't allow using print encyclopedias.

Encyclopedias are considered good introductions to topics. Encyclopedias reliably introduce vocabulary, various subfields of the topic, different approaches to the topic, fundamental issues and problems, important people in the field, and good sources for further reading. 

Wikipedia does the same thing.

When Wikipedia came out, librarians debated whether Wikipedia was better or worse than authorized editing of print encyclopedias. The consensus seems to be that Wikipedia is a good encyclopedia overall, despite the possibility of the sabotage of some articles, e.g., biographies of politicians.

"&gt;BOSTON  Rescue crews in the Atlantic Ocean detected potential signs of life again on Wednesday as they continue searching for a submersible that went missing during an expedition to the site of the Titanic wreckage.

&gt;According to the U.S. Coast Guard, a Canadian P-3 aircraft detected underwater noises in the search area on Tuesday. Because of those noises, the operations were relocated ""in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises.""


&gt;Coast Guard Capt. Jamie Frederick said in a Wednesday afternoon news conference that the sounds ""have been described as banging noises."" He said the P-3 also detected noises on Wednesday.

&gt;We don't know what they are, to be frank with you,"" Frederick said. ""We're searching in the area where the noises were detected.""

&gt;Coast Guard says noises heard again in search for missing Titanic-bound sub
The search area has now expanded to two times the size of Connecticut. Two remotely operated underwater vehicles are ""actively"" searching below the surface and more are on the way.

&gt;The submersible had as much as 96 hours of oxygen when it began the expedition on Sunday morning, as well as limited food and water rations, Frederick said.

&gt;This is a search and rescue mission, 100%"" he said. ""We need to have hope.""

&gt;The Coast Guard tweeted that three vessels arrived Wednesday morning. The John Cabot has side-scanning sonar capabilities and is searching alongside the Skandi Vinland and the Atlantic Merlin.


&gt;The 21-foot Titan vessel submerged Sunday morning around 8 a.m. and was expected to resurface at 3 p.m. that day. The crew of the Canadian research vessel Polar Prince lost contact with the submersible about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the dive, the Coast Guard said.

&gt;OceanGate Expeditions, a company that deploys manned submersibles for deep-sea expeditions, operates the missing vessel. The company did not say whether any of the people on board are paying tourists. It takes them as passengers on its expeditions.

&gt;The wreckage of the Titanic is about 13,000 feet under the surface.  

&gt;Among the confirmed passengers are British businessman Hamish Harding; Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his teenage son, Suleman; and French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet. Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, the company that operates the vessel, is also on it., a British billionaire and adventure traveler, is among the group of those missing.",0

"&gt; Im not sure why the idea of God can only be considered through the lens of religion

God is a religious figure.

&gt; God is essentially the essence and proclamation of gratitude and oneness, within the lands people share.

"Its difficult for me to condense a good explanation but if people are interested I can post a detailed breakdown in a different thread, or maybe in a different subreddit.

But a really, really simplified way to understand it is to think of **rechargeable** lithium-ion batteries as an analog to a biological system where almost every tiny bit of change in a component of the system results in drastic changes in how the battery behaves. Let me be clear that qualifying a new battery chemistry, or a modification to existing battery chemistry is an arduous process because it takes a long series of different tests to confidently greenlight it for mass commercialization. Chemistry is a simplified term which basically means a unique combination of anode, cathode, electrolyte, a wide array of additives, the binders for each component, the nanoscale material design features of the active components, the relative ratios of components, how each component is *integrated* in the cell, how the cell is *balanced* - the list is very long.

Why certain chemistries fail to scale is either because the way the combination was constructed is commercially impractical, or a specific novel component cannot be mass manufactured, or worse - the combination only works for very limited and specific usage conditions. Even the way they are tested in the lab-scale is also another reason why scaling is difficult later. This means unreliable selection of the format of the cells - common *cheats* include testing in coin cells with excessive electrolyte, making the electrodes in a way that is completely impractical for the real world, or excessively limiting the voltage window of the cells during cycling, or reporting the energy density of the cell outside its cycling window from only a couple of cycles - its never going to end if I write them here.

Imagine the environment the most advanced modern-day rechargeable batteries have to operate in: a wide range of ambient conditions, dynamic demand profiles including rapid discharge and fast charge, pulse loads - another long list. There is also another problem with alternative chemistries beyond conventional lithium-ion cells: even if everything else passes the tests you now have to take a major sacrifice in either energy density or costs or both, and then consumers and end-users do not want to accept that sacrifice in their EVs and electronics.

"Sorry, but she's not the girl for you.

In a few years after she has had a lot of meaningless, terrible and unemotional sex, she will likely call you and tell you what a terrible mistake she made throwing in the towel on a decent relationship. And all because she felt like she was missing out on something that really isn't very fulfilling or enjoyable.

I am 40 and have had periods of single life with some casual flings here and there and they didn't measure up to making love in a solid, emotional and caring relationship one bit.

Each to their own. If somebody really knows themself well enough to absolutely not want a relationship and just need their sexual needs fulfilled, fair play to them

But there is plenty of evidence from humans that have been doing this for centuries.. we aren't all that different. 

I'm not saying they don't work.. but statistically - open relationships rarely work, being promiscuous and racking up a body count is basically an exercise in wrecking your self esteem and ego and waking up every morning with a little bit more regret. I'd rather have one person that I really cared about than hooking up with a different person every night. It eventually leads to questioning who you are and what you really want.

"One potential problem is that you are seeing these situations as win/lose. Not you both working together for a common goal.

 I get what you mean though logically it doesn't make sense. Is she hungry is she not hungry, does she want you to go or stay? It doesn't make sense to us men because there is a third variable influencing the first two that we can't detect. I would recommend marriage counselling, not because I think you two are necessarily heading to divorce but because it allows an outside professional perspective to see what that third variable is and give you an understanding on how to manage it. 

All in all she just wants to know that you care and that you love her unconditionally even when she isn't being reasonable/rational.

Now I'm getting into blind speculation.  I suspect that there was some kind of difficulty in her early home life? It could be a divorce, but if I had to bet money I would say she experienced some form of relational trauma akin to being in the foster care system for a time.

Furthermore, photos take one shot at one angle and human beings are meant to be in motion. Camera lenses aside, the lack of movement,  change of lighting,  and the right angles can account for why you don't look good on photos.  I'd tell you to practice your angles in the mirror,  find the one where you look best and then try to replicate it in a photo. 

I'd also keep in mind that 90% of attractiveness is how you put yourself together.  Idc if you're a straight guy,  a good haircut,  well trimmed beard, and small makeup products can hide or fix blemishes with ease.

The problem is, Russia *does* have nuclear weapons, and it doesnt seem of particularly sound mind. So everything is treated with an abundance of caution. Its like, say you owned a farm.

Her friendships are not ""less important"" than his insecurities. That is not what this situation is.

""She has to forgo friends because he doesn't plan to keep the relationship interesting enough?!"" What are you even talking about at this point? Where did OP say or imply any of this?

This post, is about OP feeling uncomfortable that his S/O is doing something that's over his relational boundaries, and they wanted advice on how to communicate this to their S/O. OP also later updated the post, saying that they did discuss the situation with his S/O, and that they agreed to break contact.

""One doesn't need to be harsh with those who fall for them."" Yes. They do, when the other man is not taking the hint. She's in a relationship, and the other guy isn't willing to relent. Especially since she has a past with this other man. That's a very different kind of situation, from anything that you've described so far. This other man is not her friend. He is a *suitor.* Hence my comment about her leading them on.

You cannot be friends with someone who does not want to be friends with you. Lovers =/= friends. Anything else is infidelity (barring things like polyamory.) I can't make it any more simple than that.

Also, we *are* animals, on a biological level. Our emotional and physical behaviors, stem *directly* from our evolutionary heritage. Including the masculine instinctual need, to be territorial. We are all trying to rise above our base instincts, and it's not ok to act like a monkey or something, obviously. But you do have to acknowledge, that these traits exists, and respect them.

That they still absolutely loved their partners but that in a monogamous relationship after a while the sex gets stale, so they seek that excitement elsewhere. But the article cautioned that this poll was taken with Ashley Madison users, who are people actively seeking to cheat but stay with their partners whom they love. That its different from people who fall into affairs which can be a more emotional connection as well as sexual. I think its probably because they again, they love their partner- but being with one person for a long time, it can be challenging to keep it sexy. They might just crave the excitement of the experience and the ego boost of feeling desired. In the end- they dont want to be with that person long term, they just want to feel that feeling again.",0

I've seen an unfortunate amount of TERFs pushing for downright eugenicist and ableist responses, such as proposing autistic people be disqualified from gender care, that autistic adults should be automatically placed under conservatorships (by people who will assumedly prevent them from making their own medical decisions), that autistic adults should not be allowed to interact with minors- all heinous, awful stuff.

"Norway already has the potential to be self-sustaining when it comes to fertilizer, by capturing phosphor from their aquaculture farms.

No doubt this is an important find, but for Norway it's certainly not only positives. Mining is a horrendous operation that deeply damages the land and surrounding ecosystems. If this deposit is in sapmi lands, there's going to be bitter feuds over who has the rights to the land (spoiler: the mining companies will win).

The use of mined phosphate as fertilizer also leads to major pollution of lakes and oceans from agricultural runoff, causing overfertilization with algal blooms and oxygen deprivation as the result. Enormous areas of the baltic sea are dead or nearly dead already.

The world can't continue to use use phosphate rock as fertilizer. We need to capture agricultural runoff and reuse the nutrients instead, anything else is unsustainable in the long run.",0

Then, once he got elected, he ended up committing many of those same war crimes in other countries while also markedly destabilizing the civility in our own. Republicans excused it though because at least he didnt get us into any new wars which is a pretty low bar. And then we end up with January 6th and him literally trying to steal the election in front of everyone. But whos the most prominent Republican willing to call him out? A Cheney.

However, that at least *in theory* could be fixed.

But the senate... That's constitutionally tilted towards the republicans forever.  Or at least for the foreseeable future without some massive demographic changes.

And the more people migrate based on politics, the worse this gets, as there are simply more red states, mostly with lower populations.  

You add the filibuster in there, and there's a 0.0% chance this gets better.  (But like the House gerrymander, that's at least in theory fixable, where the senate balance isn't.)",0
"I agree with your first point, that sometimes people do push it to extremes when it comes to who your SO can and cannot talk to, if OP didnt want her boyfriend to ever hug another friend because theyre a girl then yeah, Id say that is just way too much.

And yeah when I meant brush her off, I mean I understand him pulling out her grasp for a second to comfort the girl but he could of at least acknowledged his gf instead of pulling away from her and not even saying like just one second or something along those lines.

As for the third point, like I said he doesnt need to try to get all of his friends to kick her out of the group, but i think him saying hey maybe dont say things like that will at least make OP feel a little better. It would just be more reassuring for OP that her boyfriend cares enough to know what the ex says is disrespectful &amp; probably embarrassing as hell for OP.

"People will point to some things that will show an increase in women being traffic after prostitution is legalized. 

But I have never seen data that actually proves it because it fails to account for many things. 


Like is trafficking increased or did more just get caught because usually the laws legalizing prostitution also target traffickers?

Is trafficking increased or is more just getting reported because the women involved feel safer reporting it?

Then they also fail to take it step further as well. If trafficking is being increased what is the actual cause? Does demand for prostitutes actual rise once it is legalized? How is that demand being met if so? Are the regulations so extreme the demand gets met from illegal trafficking? Etc etc.


Like it is a potentially legitimate concern. Like if you legalize drugs/alcohol you should make sure the stuff being sold is being safely and legally sold. If you legalize prostitution the same can be said for those services. But people will use bad studies and correlation to prove legalizing it as a whole is bad instead of looking for ways to continually improve.",0

Honestly nothing in human history really compares. Sure there has been lots of slavery in human but a population of slaves like what America had is fairly unique

And actually I'll randomly add to this thought: It's crazy how humans abuse each other until someone cries. Crying is the universal ""I've had enough"" signal that people give off, and it really shouldn't get to that point, but it often does, and it's sad that that's what it takes sometime, to snap people out of their abusive behavior.

Really I cannot understand how altogether Erdogan could bring himself to shoot down that Russian jet just after so many peaceful and economic talks with Putin recently about all those great gas-oil projects potentially coming soon. I think Russia will answ,1
Well I think at the moment no military official can independently order to shoot down a Russian aircraft without the president confirmation because in the worst case it can mean a war and now I guess nobody wants a military conflict with Russia or China.,1
But now it has happened and Erdogan seems to keep silence concerning the accident and I think so makes the relationship with Russia worse although first of all it's his task to clarify the issue and make friends with Putin again.,1
Partly right and surely NATO will buck up its ally Turkey but sooner or later either anti-ISIS alliance or Russia or they together will destroy oil facilities of ISIS in Syria on the other hand Putin will suspend that gas project with Turks so it'll be the,1
Very sarcastic but exactly correct and it's seems normal concerning Turkish-Russian relationship - first Russia accuses Turkey in that infamous Armenian genocide making them quite unfriendly but then Putin offers Erdogan that gas project just like they are,1
I think in the case of another war on the Soviet Union in 1945 Poland could have become extinct altogether so they were quite lucky then neither Roosevelt nor Churchill started it.,1
In this case we are all quite lucky it was a Russian jet shot down by Turks because today any local nuclear conflicts are just impossible without spreading worldwide sooner or later.,1
That's the point - reportedly.,1
I think you are right except civilians with arms cannot already be called pure civilians so I guess militants kill militants and the problem of this incident is that Russian jet was shot by Turkey which would-be    a so-called anti-ISIS coalition member to,1
"Well on the other hand Turks themselves have bombed mostly Kurds in Syria while this conflict but not ISIS targets, haven't they? So we can expect Russians in the guise of Syrians of course will shoot down a couple of their jets on a mission too.",1
"Also parents, how did you know when you wanted kids? - I always wanted to have a good family with kids and I was married thrice but only my last marriage when I met a girl whom I loved like crazy made me happy and just then I felt exactly ready for kids",1
Or you'll find someone with whom you'll want them too - only love can solve such problems according to my own experience.,1
Well agree and Russia and Turkey are on the same side in the region to shoot down planes of each other besides to down a plane is a minor thing but to kill military pilots is just a military crime I think.,1
Well they shot down a Russian plane so after that accident surely Russians will be more suspicious about going to Turkey to have vocations moreover it can be prohibited by their government completely I guess.,1
For me it's more about practical wits of the first fisherman than all the rest.,1
It seems a very old joke because they didn't even think about one more way quite evident nowadays.,1
It's not equal losses - just Turkish tourism vs huge Russian gas projects in my opinion.,1

Pop-unders are hardly better. Will they punish pop-under users?,1

How long is a short skirt?,1
No psThey are friends,1
And this is what I call good news,1
I checked this pic thru karmadecay and there were none,1
Just a new evidence that our presidential elections lead us to nowhere...,1

Europe just needs to have some rest from its countless refugees,1

That's a good news! Hate it when they remake the masterpieces!,1
Or they are just honest lol,1
That's perfect.That's exactly how the IS propaganda works. People have to be frightened of the enemy created by the CIA conspiracies. Then they won;t argue with the army destroying the Middle East.,1

So now the FBI director admits that he has no power to enforce the PD do something. Even if that provides safety to the citizens.,1

I dream about the day when peer-to-peer transactions are indeed fast,1
Don't be surprised in case you don't receive your money after 2 months,1
But it still uses intrusive ads,1
"Enigma is an interesting coin and I guess many know it.I agree with you that Zcash is underestimated. And I also read about Ties.Network, it has big potential.",1
"This database would have a wide range of applications in several fields, including, for instance, big data and mass media. I also read that these guys are going to launch a secure, trustworthy professional network for those who work in IT industry.",1
Bad news for brilliant business-minds like JP Morgan CEO who claimed that cryptocurrencies are useless and cost nothing,1

Ethereum has been killing it for a long period of time. I agree with you that Ethereum is more convenient to transfer and trade.,1
"To be honest, it is hilarious to read about guys who look at ethereum like AOL or MySpace.While new platforms like Stellar or Ties (it's not that popular, that's why you have to check it out) emerge, Ethereum still remains no.1 for people creating dapp",1

"The medication I'm prescribing is to stop focusing on major cryptos and take a wider perspective. There are a lot of barely known tokens that can increase significantly. Enigma, SALT, Ties. Not shilling, just giving you some examples.",1
"I wouldd rather buy NERVcoins, tbh.",1
"I want to start fresh after the crash and decided to focus more on projects offering important services that satisfy needs of people. Ties.DB, for example.",1
What a bear trap!,1
Haters gonna say it's real,1
Stay calm. We are early investors.,1
"I have decided to stay in the game, hodl and modify my portfolio.  Instead of major cryptocurrencies, there are several reasons to pay more attention to high-potential platforms which are known just among IT geeks. Good examples would be Ties and Primas.",1

Between that and the situation in India I'm starting to feel better,1
CoinBase really fudged up.,1
Certainly TIE.,1
"I would recommend to keep a close eye on unpopular but promising platforms like SALT, Storm and Ties",1
TIE and SPHR. I like them because they are based on platforms that can be extremely useful for crypto community.,1
Cryptomom,1
Good news!,1
When it will be done?,1
They wouldn’t tell me how daylight savings time effects my coinhours,1
"Perspective, changing lives every day.",1
"I would advise to pay more attention to tokens like SALT, Storm and Ties",1
PST ($16m) and TIE ($10m). Promising projects since they offer useful services for crypto fans.,1
I'm surprised that this guy is still alive.,1
"Probably, buying and hodling Telcoin would be a wise investment.",1
"If I had $10k, I would buy several major cryptos like Ether, Ripple or IOTA and altcoins like SALT, Storm and Ties",1
Actually it looks like they don't want to assist the prevailing force that will make them irrelevant,1
I'm still scolding myself for missing the Request ICO,1

Pass me the weed bro,1

Extremely huge for IOTA!,1
Fucking Gavin Wood from Polka Dot?,1
Who even took advice from these idiots?!,1

"Pretty interesting guide for beginners and then pretty strange portfolio... I would recommend keeping a close eye on promising platforms like SALT, Storm, and Ties",1
Activate quantum immortality,1
Thankfully cryptos will dispose of those badass exchanges!,1
This really is the Wild West.,1
Decentralized public databases. I would point out Ties.DB.,1
Ties and Storm,1
Wonderful!,1
Those Twitter scam things need to go.,1
Good! Well done Neblio team,1
I cannot understand how people can fall for this.,1
"I would recommend investing in several top 25 cryptos like ETH, XRP, etc. and emerging tokens having a great potential like PST and TIE",1
"I regret that when I started buying cryptos and was a noob I bought only big cryptos. It was a big mistake. I could have bought many promising coins and tokens that eventually hit top 50. Now I bear it in mind and hodl several altcoins, including TIE, PST",1

And Erdogan's right to be afraid because even North Korea is boasting to nuke them if Turks don't stop bombing Syria.,1
So is it a war coming?,1
Agree - for me it's like a joke really.,1
"But that president of NK says always about it, you think he's lying?",1
America has enough guts so everything is yet possible.,1
Both Russia and Turkey have warned their people not to go to each other I've heard just like before a war.,1
But when - recently or at the Cold War times?,1
Then just before Crimea affair I guess. Really it's very interesting to go there and see everything myself.,1
Christmas is a great cultural tradition worthy to stay untouched forever in any Christian country like Italy or France because I think strange people should adjust to the local culture but not vice versa.,1
I think that's too far.,1
Exactly!,1
"No, I don't think so especially when a religious practice has gone into a certain cultural traditions long ago. Well it's OK for me to go into a church of any confession to pray and to burn a candle and I don't think I betray my original faith.",1
Agree completely and support your opinion absolutely besides I don't think it's bad if Muslim children can just listen to our carols sitting in the hall and vise versa Christian children can visit some Muslim festivals in the same school concert hall. And,1
"I see your point, OK but I take the present majority of the local people and I don't find it's quite correct to use digits of the past concerning this matter.",1
I find Merkel one of the strongest politicians of our time so to criticize her is OK but make her to resign at the moment is quite unreasonable  I guess besides Angela will never resign on her own anyway.,1
But really why did they trow her away - they could use her in a multiple other ways indeed.,1
Really you are right but the above version is OK too.,1
Me either.,1
And that's true definitely.,1
"And it's really strange, isn't it because the multiculturalism should enrich our life and traditions greatly but in reality it's just oppositely.",1
'Celebrating Christmas is part of being Italian.' And I don't see anything wrong in it especially to be banned in schools or colleges.,1
And they do it in good-good time indeed.,1
Of course Merkel alone cannot solve completely the problem created by other guys somewhere far far away from Germany but I think she will contribute in solving it at least partly.,1
Thank a lot!,1
You know children are grown up by their biased parents so this way to make our world a better place I think is doomed to be a failure too.,1
Your sarcasm is perfect but not everybody seems to understand it well.,1
And xenophobia of the local is another problem which is resulting out of the migrant crisis and finally they both create that vicious circle nearly insuperable for all.,1
This way or another we will all die eventually so all variety of problems should be tackled simultaneously if the mankind is going to persist.,1
She is a tough woman and she'll be fighting until the last possibility to solve he problem.,1

Well there are Jews everywhere but Israel is single.,1
But i think it's not the case in the Middle East region or in Muslim African countries - it's just the present posture of affairs.,1

Debates about gun laws may be endless. This is not surprising that such accidents happen in Chicago. 80% of homicides in Chicago involve firearms.,1
Do you think that wiretapping of American citizens is necessary for security of America and Americans?,1
"If the attackers are Muslims it's a very bad sign for Europe.Yeah, that's clearly understandable that Europeans just want to help those who are in need. But they really undermine the very foundation of their society based on old Christian values. I'm not",1
What was the point of banning them in the first place? All those drugs were used for medical purposes when they were created. 50 years have passed and only now people are slowly starting to open their mind just like they did it in the late 60s.,1
"Well, they are kinda right. Racism still exists in America and it's not like we can change anything about that. It would be better to learn how to live with it because we can't change the human nature. Cops are usually not the brightest people so they use",1

That's such an old song. We need to change something about our copyright laws. I think every song/movie/videogame has to be allowed for downloading for free in 20 years after its release.,1
"Why are they even do that? I mean accepting so many refugees... At least they have to check their background to make sure there are no ISIS supporters among them. Well, we definitely need to help those who are in need but we don't need to put our own house",1
"And that's the country we are going to make our ally. Better to stick with Israel, it's the only democratic country in the middle east.",1
"Ted Cruz is a horrible politician. His just follows Trump everywhere, he doesn't have his own agenda. I can't see any good GOP candidate this time though Democrats are not any better.",1
Trump and Sanders are completely different candidates. It would be more appropriate to compare Trump and Biden though his hasn't announced his campaign yet.,1
She has always been a hawk there is nothing new here. She just appeals to Trump's audience cause it seems like there are more Americans leaning towards conservatives. So she decided to abandon her liberal agenda.,1
I believe that feminism is the cause. They want to find a strong man to depend on but can't find one in the West so they flee to the Middle East in order to find happiness.,1
"It won't help him to win anyway. Not too many people are going to vote for Sanders, he is way too liberal and way too progressive.",1
Trump just went way too far. He needs to care more about the things he says because he sounds like a racist and bigot. Though it looks like people don't care about it and he will be the next president.,1
Why does he even run for the president? He has no change to win anyway. I can't understand all those GOP candidates who still keep trying.,1
"Trump is just a master troll. His supporters don't care about the things he says anymore, he is like the messiah for them. They just agree with Trump no matter what he says.",1
I can't get it why European leaders blindly follow liberal agenda. The most strange thing is that Europeans in general don't even support multiculturalism but still they can't do anything about it.,1
Our healthcare system is just broken. If only we could destroy all those churches we have everywhere and build hospitals instead... We really need to change something in our healthcare.,1
I wonder what needs to happen in the head of a person who feels sexual attraction to little kids. It's so disgusting and unnatural. And pedophiles constantly cry that the society doesn't understand them... There is nothing to understand there really. All p,1
"I don't believe in God but I can't understand those militant atheists. Christianity is not a religion any more, it's just a way of life and a sort of a culture within culture. People just love those symbols as they feel belonging to the group of people who",1
That always happens if a person feels too much power. Especially if he is not the brightest bulb in the bunch. We need to do something about our police but I have idea what we have to do.,1
It's so fun for some reason to joke about ISIS. I see nothing fun in it. Thousands of people are getting killed every month and it's not like it's going to stop anytime soon.,1
"Churches are suing atheists, atheists are suing believers and no one can understand why they are acting this way. There is nothing bad in topless protests as long as the girls are pretty.",1
He shouldn't create a family in the first place if he earns a minimum wage. He should care more about searching for a good job and getting required skills to earn more money.,1
I still can't understand why we are so violent. America is the richest country in the world but for some reason there are many things which are even worse than in some third world countries.,1
They raise minimum wage -&gt; everything gets more expensive -&gt; you have to raise wages againThat's a vicious circle.,1
No one cares about all those irrelevant candidates. I have no idea why they even decide to run for president. They've just lost money and reputation.,1
"Damn, Saudi Arabia is just a crazy country. They cut off hands for thievery, I can't even imagine that there is a country where people literally live in the middle ages. And for some reason this country is the main ally in the region. Pretty weird.",1
God damn I hate those copyrights. Everyone knows this song and everyone should feel free to use it. I don't think Beethoven would be very happy to see what happened to the music industry,1
There are millions of people who are literally starving and this guy got 21 million dollars. Life is truly unfair.,1
Internet is the only place of real freedom we have. I don't want to see the Internet being censored and castrated. If you want to get the information that pleases your masters then get a TV.,1
"I'm sure they arrested him because he doesn't look white. I'm so sorry for him, he is probably a really clever guy. It's just the racist society we are living in is to blame.",1
Finally. They should have done it many years ago. I still can't understand why the food chains can't sell booze. How are they any different from pubs?,1
"Cops are bastards. Really, there are so many stories showing their incompetency that I'm starting to think that they hire only completely insane people there.",1
"Soon there will be no jobs in the US at all. That's the way to nowhere, we can't always outsource our jobs to poor unstable countries. There are thousands of people in the US who can't find a job here and such measures will only increase unemployment.",1
Poor Alabama don't even know anymore where to get money so it introduces dumb laws.Anyway all porn is watched on the internet nowadays for free so the tax just won't work.,1
We need to save the bees. Their populations are decreasing rapidly due to all those toxins in the air. That's sad that the nature is slowly dying and we can't do anything to save it.,1
"Those ISIS videos are really very tough. I can't get it why we still didn't invade ISIS and didn't stop those terrorists, it's getting worse with every passing day.",1
Why he was in prison in the first place? He needs to be kept in a mental asylum forever. Such people should not roam free on streets.,1
I hate that they always check for my phone number when I sign up for gmail or yahoo. That's just a USSR tier surveillance.,1
"Looks like someone is being scared that democrats are not going to win this time, right? So suddenly everyone has an urge to install brand new hackable machines.",1
Bernie Sanders is just an old communist. He should retire already and spend his last days in peace. He won't become the president so what's the point to run?,1
"This is actually a very deep problem. Muslims are surely not a race, but people everywhere in the world are racist towards Muslims. That's sad that the whole religion is hated because of a bunch of terrorists.",1
American schools have so high level of security that they look more like concentration camps than actual schools. Everything should have its limits.,1
That's great he helps the refugees. Though I still can't understand why they don't go to other Muslim countries that don't have civil wars.,1
Why is Nepal even separated from India? Why are they different states? There are dozens of different nations living now in India.,1
I hope they will really fighting ISIS terrorists and not Assad. Because it seems now that the main goal is overthrowing Assad regime and not defeat ISIS.,1
Looks like no one wants those immigrants in their countries. Europeans should not have claimed that they are able to take so many of them. Cause there are thousands of people who don't have food and money who just want to get warm clothes and a place to sl,1
"There will be much more ISIS leaders in future. It's like a hydra: once you cut off one head, two more appear.",1
I hope it won't end up with a big bloodshed. Both Israelis and Palestinians need to learn how to live in peace cause there is no other way out of this situation.,1

absolutely! That is one of the terriblest examples of raising a kid in a way he was not supposed to be,1

I get your point. Added an edit to the post,1

I suppose you can effectively begin a new thread here on CMV,1
"You see, my point here is that a person need to know and understand the concept of gender rather than thinking that every person is genderless. So could you please tell me how your vision of gender insignificance correlates with my original post?...",1
"Erm, no, that was supposed to be a reply to someone in the thread who suggested me raise the child as an opposite gender, as we're speaking here generally",1

"Yeah, this time it is too late.",1
"You are absolutely right. Black people are played like fools. They do not need lot's of clever and successful black people. Democrats are happy to spend billion on Welfare and different governmental programs, build new private prisons etc. Bur they do not",1
"&gt; we can't finance we can't influence politicsRight. To my mins all minor political parties are just an illusion, creating the illusion of non bipartisan political system.",1
"I am not a bot or a shitposter. Moreover, they banned me from partisopating on r/Anarchism for a couple of simple posts. They were not offtop. Thank you for the ban and complaining to admins!",1
"90% of our mass midia is biassed, contolled &amp; run by our bipartsan system. Forget about free press. Several corporations run by muguls control the media. And this is not conspiracy. GE\Comcast,  News-Corp. , CBS-Corporation, Time-Warner, Walt Disney, V",1
"You are crazy! I read that so-called 'shit' before i post and save bookmarks in your browser. I have no time sitting here for all day long. Like you do, old jackdow.",1

"Really good analysis. I think you HAVE to contact with guys from blackmatters and tell them you thoughts. It could be good for content and, may be, for your sureddit. Cause problems of racism need to be covered in press.",1
"&gt; You are literally retarded.Seems, you are simply retarded.",1
"My arguments are not worse than yours, downer.",1
&gt; Because nothing betters your cause and bridges the divide between cops and citizens better than Fuck the policeLooks like that the solution of racism problem and social tentions has just been found.,1
"Sorry, i have a bad morning today and answered you under pressure of time.",1
"Practically every article is somebody's biased opinion. Of course, if we are not talking about exact sciences.",1
Democrats still believe they are able to believe poverty. What's the difference between a Democrat and a prostitute? The prostitute gives value for the money she takes.,1
"Yeah, Israel is the main peace-monger of the Middle East. A big one!",1
"I guess, it isn't a parody site, i have read about this brave guy somewhere else. I agree with, he is not just brave, it was rather reckless act.",1
'Allegedly' is a perfect word to avoid responsibility. Clinton cheated on his wife in 1998. At least in 1998 it became known to the public.,1
"too lenient sentence, i think",1
Thanks for invitation.,1
"To tell the truth, the guy is lucky he was not tasered.",1
"The source of information is not alternative, but news hook is.",1
Cops don't give a shit about falsely accusing people because they are not afraif of responsibility or charges. They know that government (judges) will cover them. And maximum penalty in most cases is paid leave or dismissal. And after that they easily star,1
Both are criminals.,1
"Whatever you say about Comcast, their fluffy cartoons etc. They are at the forefront among corporations who officially spend millions on building and strengthening relationships with our government.",1
They fear for their piad leave and pensions only.,1
Fix the unemployment problem and you'll fix all this.,1
&gt; only a narrow and incomplete version...which allows police officers to beat the rap again and again.,1
"May be Allah and Quran do not allow them take the drugs. Nevertheless, heroin and hashish is a common thing for them, especially Muslims of the Middle East. Also Quran prohibits beheading people.",1
I have just read that Bill Gates and his wife Melinda give away lot's of money to charity.,1
"Agree. If words We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children are not racist,  i know nothing about racism.",1
Next is Hillary. She is already 68.,1
"CIA, FBI ans State Department pay, i think. Under cover of Soros.",1
Fakenberg,1
"Tell Hillary about. I've heard she likes good talks abour private servers.Seriously, i think you are right. But State Department will not approve such an approach.",1
Kudos!,1
"Cause he votes for Dems, i guess? And gets sponsorship from our government to spy on us.",1
That's it! 1) It's not about friends.2) There are dozens of news aggregators for every taste and level of intelligence.,1
Cap tells me that you are too obvious.,1
&gt; Mark Zuckerberg: Fuck off you fucking dumb fucks...post more pictures......We need more gold,1
&gt; Lock him up Lock him up in public restroom alone foreever. May be he lasts a little bit more and learns about renewable energy sources,1
Thanks.,1
Thank you.,1
"&gt; They conducted an investigation and decided they did nothing wrong.Cause they are same morons, birds of feather.",1
"Piece of cake! Joined the sub, article is already there!",1
"You are absolutelly rights. Prisons are totally corrupt. No matter are they state or private prisons. State officials, prison authorities or ordinary security guards. But we should not forget that fish rots from its head.",1
I hope so! I've heard that harassing girls or sexual abuse of minors is bad for letter of recommendation. And i hope he never applies for a good state service again.,1
Bunch of simpletons fighting over fast moving consumer goods.,1
"&gt; I don't understand this line...Honestly, me too. May be, they mean that racial bias, crime rates and police shootings are not interrelated.",1
"This is the problem of the most similar studies. Even if selected subset   and other conditions of the study are correct, there are some problems. They do not have 30 years to complete the study. So, they ask different people.",1
"I agree with you, the yellow leaf brings nothing but grief.",1
&gt; They're less about true conservatism and more about exacerbating the racial divide.Bulls eye!,1
