Greta Thunberg may be the most well-known climate activist today. Along with her climate activism, she is known for her psychiatric diagnoses. In fact, these two aspects of her public persona often go together - autism and anxiety disorders are the superpowers that allow her to take a principled stand.

> I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism... I think that in many ways, we autistic are the normal ones, and the rest of the people are pretty strange, especially when it comes to the sustainability crisis, where everyone keeps saying that climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all and yet they just carry on like before. [^1]

[^1]: [Thunberg, Greta (24 November 2018). School strike for climate -- save the world by changing the rules. TEDxStockholm. Event occurs at 1:46.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A&t=106s)

Told by Thunberg herself, this is an inspiring and compelling claim. But is it true in general that autistic and/or anxious thought patterns cause people to take the sustainability crisis more seriously? Is this true even when it comes to smaller-scale activism than Thunberg's - say, involvement with environmentalist groups on Reddit?

# Gathering Data

Using the `RedditExtractoR` package in R, I gathered data on all threads over the last month from seven environmentalist communities on Reddit: r/Environmentalism, r/sustainability, r/ZeroWaste, r/climate, r/environment, r/SustainabilityPorn, and r/Green.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda) 
library(quanteda.sentiment)
# library(text)
library(RedditExtractoR)
```

```{r}
env_communities <- c("Environmentalism", "sustainability", "ZeroWaste", "climate", "environment", "SustainabilityPorn", "Green")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

env_threads <- bind_rows(lapply(env_communities, function(community){find_thread_urls(subreddit = community)}))

env_threadcontent <- get_thread_content(env_threads$url)
env_threads <- env_threadcontent$threads
env_threadcontent <- env_threadcontent$comments
```

As a control group, I chose seven communities with broadly similar themes, but without any sustainability-specific agenda: r/worldnews, r/makerspace, r/NoStupidQuestions, r/gardening, r/politics, r/relationship_advice, and r/news.

```{r}
#| eval: false
control_communities <- c("worldnews", "makerspace", "NoStupidQuestions", "gardening", "politics", "relationship_advice", "news")

control_threads <- bind_rows(lapply(control_communities, function(community){find_thread_urls(subreddit = community)}))

control_threadcontent <- get_thread_content(sample(control_threads$url, 500))
control_threads <- control_threadcontent$threads
control_threadcontent <- control_threadcontent$comments
```

All texts went through a simple preprocessing step to remove links, email addresses, and punctuation.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# preprocessing - using stringr
preprocess <- function(text_vec){
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, "\\b[:alnum:]+@[:alnum:]+\\.[:lower:]+\\b", "") # email addresses
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, 'http://[^"\\s]+|https://[^"\\s]+', " ")  # links
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, '\\\031|&gt;', "")      # remove punctuation
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, '\\\n|\\\t', " ")      # remove punctuation
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, '[:punct:]', "")      # remove punctuation
  text_vec <- str_replace_all(text_vec, '[.+]', " ")      # remove removed/deleted tags
  str_to_lower(text_vec)   # to lowercase
}

control_threads$title_preprocessed <- preprocess(control_threads$title)
control_threads$text_preprocessed <- preprocess(control_threads$text)
control_threadcontent$comment_preprocessed <- preprocess(control_threadcontent$comment)
env_threads$title_preprocessed <- preprocess(env_threads$title)
env_threads$text_preprocessed <- preprocess(env_threads$text)
env_threadcontent$comment_preprocessed <- preprocess(env_threadcontent$comment)
```

# Measuring Autism in Text

## Neutralized CCR

In [my last post](https://rimonim.github.io/blog/text_comparison/), I explored various methods of quantifying psychological content in text, including contextualized construct representation (CCR)[^2], which leverages the power of large language models to turn established psychiatric questionnaires into embeddings - lists of activations of neurons in the model - that can be compared to the same model's embeddings of other texts.

[^2]: Atari, M., Omrani, A., & Dehghani, M. (2023, February 24). Contextualized construct representation: Leveraging psychometric scales to advance theory-driven text analysis. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/m93pd

Toward the end of that post, I raised a potential difficulty with this method: How can I be sure that I am not measuring the extent to which people write like they're writing a questionnaire? This is critical, since questionnaires tend to be written in formal, well organized, full sentences, and certain psychological constructs might lead to people writing less - or more - like that.

The solution I proposed was to create a "neutralized" version of the questionnaire average embedding, which reflects each original question *and its grammatical negation*. By subtracting out this neutralized embedding (which nevertheless maintains its questionnaire-ness all around) from the original embedding, I can isolate the psychological construct of interest without fear of confounds from the particular writing style of the questionnaire. This is the approach I will take here, using the Adult Social Behavior Questionnaire (ASBQ)[^3] for clinical assessment of autism spectrum disorder in adults. The questionnaire includes six subscales: reduced contact, reduced empathy, reduced interpersonal insight, violations of social conventions, insistence on sameness, and sensory stimulation and motor stereotypes. Excluding the last one (I have a hard time imagining how it would apply to Reddit activity), I will treat each subscale on its own.

(2016). Clinical assessment of ASD in adults using self- and other-report : Psychometric properties and validity of the Adult Social Behavior Questionnaire (ASBQ). *Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 24*, 17-28.

As in my last post, I am using embeddings from the second to last layer of BERT (base uncased).

## r/aspergers

My second metric for autistic tendencies is less sensitive to the nuances of various ASD symptoms, but is more directly tailored to the task at hand. The r/aspergers subreddit describes itself as "the internet's largest community of people affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder". So here, I am simply going to compute the average embedding of posts in this group and use it as a paradigm of the construct of interest.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ASD_threads <- find_thread_urls(subreddit = "aspergers")

ASD_threads$full_text <- preprocess(paste(ASD_threads$title, ASD_threads$text))

# Embedding
ASD_threads_embeddings <- textEmbed(ASD_threads$full_text)$texts[[1]]

# Average Embedding
ASD <- ASD_threads_embeddings %>% 
  summarise(across(Dim1_texts:Dim768_texts, mean)) %>% 
  unlist(use.names=FALSE)
```

# Measuring Anxiety in Text

## Kaggle Dataset

I could easily take the same approach for anxiety as I did for autism. I could even use questionnaires designed specifically for OCD and selective mutism, the diagnoses mentioned by Greta Thunberg in the quote above. Nevertheless, I am going to use a different, more straightforward method: [the Students Anxiety and Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahasourav17/students-anxiety-and-depression-dataset) includes 733 handcoded examples of social media posts and comments that reflect anxiety. I will simply take the average BERT embedding of these as the quintessence of anxiety on social media.

```{r}
#| eval: false
anxiety_texts <- readxl::read_xlsx("dataset.xlsx") %>% 
  filter(label == 1) %>% pull(text)

anxiety_texts <- preprocess(anxiety_texts)

anxiety <- textEmbed(anxiety_texts)$texts[[1]] %>% 
  summarise(across(Dim1_texts:Dim768_texts, mean)) %>% 
  unlist(use.names=FALSE)
```

## r/OCD

As with ASD above, my second metric will simply be an average embedding of posts on a disorder-specific subreddit. This time, r/OCD.

```{r}
#| eval: false
OCD_threads <- find_thread_urls(subreddit = "OCD")

OCD_threads$full_text <- preprocess(paste(OCD_threads$title, OCD_threads$text))

OCD_threads_subset <- slice_sample(OCD_threads, n = 100)

# Embedding
OCD_threads_embeddings <- textEmbed(OCD_threads$full_text)$texts[[1]]

# Average Embedding
OCD <- OCD_threads_embeddings %>% 
  summarise(across(Dim1_texts:Dim768_texts, mean)) %>% 
  unlist(use.names=FALSE)
```

# Do environmentalists exhibit more autism and anxiety characteristics than control?

Now that I have vector representations of five autism subscales, generalized ASD, OCD, and anxiety, I can simply embed each comment in the Reddit data using the same method, and score them based on their cosine similarity to each construct embedding. Then I can use classical statistical methods to test whether environmentalists exhibit more autism and anxiety characteristics than control.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Subset Corpus
env_threadcontent_subset <- env_threadcontent %>% slice_sample(n = 1000)
control_threadcontent_subset <- control_threadcontent %>% slice_sample(n = 1000)

env_comment_embeddings <- textEmbed(env_threadcontent_subset$comment_preprocessed)$texts[[1]]

  control_threadcontent_subset$OCD[row] <- lsa::cosine(doc_embedding, OCD)
}

comments_unified <- env_threadcontent_subset %>% 
  mutate(environmentalist = 1) %>% 
  left_join(env_threads %>% select(url, subreddit)) %>% 
  bind_rows(control_threadcontent_subset %>% 
              mutate(environmentalist = 0) %>% 
              left_join(control_threads %>% select(url, subreddit)))
```

The aforementioned classical statistical methods do require some thought, though. Because the data were gathered from multiple communities, the samples are not independent, and fixed-parameter-only methods like t-tests will be biased. This is a job for multilevel modeling, with the intercept for each community allowed to vary freely around its group (environmentalist/non-environmentalist) mean.

```{r}
library(lmerTest)

reduced_contact_mod1 <- lmer(reduced_contact ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
reduced_empathy_mod1 <- lmer(reduced_empathy ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
reduced_interpersonal_insight_mod1 <- lmer(reduced_interpersonal_insight ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
violations_of_social_conventions_mod1 <- lmer(violations_of_social_conventions ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
insistence_on_sameness_mod1 <- lmer(insistence_on_sameness ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
ASD_mod1 <- lmer(ASD ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)

anxiety_mod1 <- lmer(anxiety ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)
OCD_mod1 <- lmer(OCD ~ environmentalist + (1 | subreddit), data = comments_unified)

summary(reduced_contact_mod1)
summary(reduced_empathy_mod1)
summary(reduced_interpersonal_insight_mod1)
summary(violations_of_social_conventions_mod1)
summary(insistence_on_sameness_mod1)
summary(ASD_mod1)
summary(anxiety_mod1)
summary(OCD_mod1)
```

Disappointingly, I find essentially no evidence that environmentalist and non-environmentalist communities are any different on any of these measures. There does not even seem to be a consistent trend in a particular direction.

I do want to see this visually though. In particular, I'm interested in the model's estimates for the random effect parameters. In other words: How does each subreddit score on each of the scales?

Here is that plot, with environmentalist subreddits in green. Higher indicates more of the given construct.

The only pattern that really stands out to me is how extreme r/relationship_advice is on every single one of the scales. Why that might be is beyond the scope of this post, but I suspect it will be obvious to anyone familiar with the tone of comments in that subreddit.

# But What About in Their Non-Environmentalist Activity?

So maybe the actual content of environmentalist subreddits shows no difference, but I'm not as interested in the communities themselves as much as I am interested in the *people* in the communities. Maybe these people are displaying autistic or anxious features in their other activity? To test this, I will select 100 users from the environmentalist groups, and 100 users from the control, and retrieve up to 20 threads initiated by each. Then I will repeat the same analysis, this time adding user as a random variable in addition to subreddit.

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(100)
env_user_content <- get_user_content(sample(unique(env_threadcontent$author), 100))
control_user_content <- get_user_content(sample(unique(control_threadcontent$author), 100))

env_user_threads <- lapply(env_user_content, `[[`, 3)
env_user_threads <- env_user_threads[unlist(lapply(env_user_threads, is.data.frame))]
env_user_threads <- bind_rows(env_user_threads)

control_user_threads <- lapply(control_user_content, `[[`, 3)
control_user_threads <- control_user_threads[unlist(lapply(control_user_threads, is.data.frame))]
control_user_threads <- bind_rows(control_user_threads)

env_user_threads$full_text <- preprocess(paste(env_user_threads$title, env_user_threads$text))
control_user_threads$full_text <- preprocess(paste(control_user_threads$title, control_user_threads$text))

user_threads_unified <- env_user_threads %>% 
  mutate(environmentalist = 1) %>% 
  bind_rows(control_user_threads %>% 
              mutate(environmentalist = 0)) %>% 
  group_by(author) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 20) %>% 
  ungroup()

for (row in 1:nrow(user_threads_unified_embeddings)) {
  doc_embedding <- slice(user_threads_unified_embeddings, row) %>% 
    unlist(use.names = FALSE)
  user_threads_unified$reduced_contact[row] <- lsa::cosine(doc_embedding, reduced_contact_neutralized)
  user_threads_unified$reduced_empathy[row] <- lsa::cosine(doc_embedding, reduced_empathy_neutralized)

  user_threads_unified$ASD[row] <- lsa::cosine(doc_embedding, ASD)
  user_threads_unified$OCD[row] <- lsa::cosine(doc_embedding, OCD)
}
```

```{r}

Still nothing approaching statistical significance. Everything except violations of social conventions actually shows a tiny negative trend (that is, environmentalists are slightly *less* autistic/anxious).

Actually, these findings are consistent with [this paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-76007-001)[^4], which likewise found that autistic traits are slightly negatively correlated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. 

[^4]: Taylor, E. C., Livingston, L. A., Callan, M. J., Hanel, P. H. P., & Shah, P. (2021). Do autistic traits predict pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and climate change belief? _Journal of Environmental Psychology, 76_, Article 101648. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101648

Of course, this is not to discount Greta Thunberg's account of her own psychological superpowers. She may well be an exception to the rule.

The somewhat underwhelming conclusion of this research is therefore:

Most Reddit environmentalists are not Greta Thunberg.
